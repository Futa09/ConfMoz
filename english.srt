1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,298
... Already a little but there are some things that you do not know necessarily

2
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:08,964
and then some new additions that are in the process of being concocted in the foundation

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,412
and that you will discover in the months to come

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:16,660
and to which some of you will participate, of course,

5
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:19,885
because you know that we will also make you participate

6
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,164
in this adventure ...

7
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:25,708
Therefore, it is going to happen in the following way:

8
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:29,692
there will be two presentations/presentations

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,324
that you can interrupt to ask questions, but be aware that, in all ways,

10
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:40,940
at the end of these two presentations, these two presentations, there will be a series of questions/answers

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,428
and they will be happy to answer all the questions that you might ask

12
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:51,420
therefore, I will let the speech to David who will talk to us of Mozilla, For an Open Web

13
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:55,300
Hello!

14
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,323
Here we go!

15
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,860
... well not yet ...

16
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,351
It is good, shall we start?
.. Uh, so hello!

17
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:30,602
Well as it has been announced, I called David Raschenbach-Teller , i am party to Mozilla and I am here to talk about , hehe, Mozilla, original, isn't it !?

18
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:37,222
Then, a few words, so already the spelling of my name in case you have difficulties, I see no reason why

19
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:57,504
then, who I have to introduce myself at least, therefore I am part of the team, finally one of the teams that developed firefox and company, I am part of the team performance therefore our role is to take firefox and company, find out what are slowing and kick his ass until it do not slow anymore.

20
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:05,122
I am also active in Mozilla Education, I am not the only one in this room, uh Mozilla Education, it is well ...

21
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:15,672
It is people like us who, from time to time, let us see people like you for their say "hello, it is very nice, come to join us" and that is ...

22
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:23,656
More generally, we take care of some of the communications with the universities, with the academic world so if you have any questions for us, good timing, we are here!

23
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:29,108
That is, if you want to join, i have various pseudo which typically revolve around Yoric.

24
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,900
Ok

25
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,725
what I am going to talk to you during this presentation?

26
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:41,257
Then, already one thing if I am the only one to speak I will get bored very quickly so please don't hesitate to ask questions ...

27
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,508
Uh, I like the sound of my voice but good y'a when even a few limited

28
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:50,277
so I am going to talk to you, i am going to talk to you about Mozilla, finally i when even announced it twice.

29
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:55,340
I will tell you a few words on our activities past, present and future.

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,766
Therefore in particular everything that concerned, well, the Web is open and it has already had years of fighting in the open web

31
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:12,948
I do not know at what point you are aware of what are the challenges of the open Web account but i well on the fact that by the end of my presentation, you'll be clued-up on the subject

32
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,950
I really need to take the microphone, it is for the recording or I can speak just to voice high?

33
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:26,024
Because personally I like to talk like that, I feel a little less idiot (without mic)

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,954
Ok, then let's go with the mic

35
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:41,673
I will speak to you, so I said, the issues that have already given rise to battles, battles enough, with the ... well I will talk to you ...

36
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,840
I will speak to you about the situation at the present time in this field of battle

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,003
and, uh, i will try in a very subtle way, to convince you to come and participate, because we need you.

38
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:58,164
Then, Mozilla, therefore, Mozilla, first it is a big lizard ...

39
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:09,235
Mozilla is known mainly for Firefox, which is one of the most popular browsers in the world.

40
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:14,541
Therefore, if one of you still do not know Firefox, it is the shame ...

41
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:29,385
We are also working on thunderbird, which is one of the mail clients the more used to the world that is less than the percentage of Firefox

42
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:30,801
but it is still not bad.

43
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:34,614
That is, in my view, the best email client multi-platform.

44
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:42,985
We are working on Firefox OS but I will try to not too much you talk about this because my colleague will you ... has a lot of slides on this issue.

45
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,378
Well that are our subjects ... our projects the more known.

46
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,159
It was full of other projects.

47
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:56,519
Then it was the typical projects a programming language, that I gave you, I have given you put two, we developed a new programming language which is called Rust.

48
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:04,923
We developed a small hint which is called Javascript, Sun Javascript, generally this is not a little to the prehistory of Mozilla but it is not among us.

49
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:14,258
And, well it continues to improve, it continues to propose improvements, to try to ensure that all the world to agree on a version of javascript.

50
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:20,447
Because we would like avoid that what will come, something which has already taken place a 10/15 years ...

51
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,251
And which was then called Microsoft ...

52
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,174
Uh, we worked on plenty of other things.

53
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:30,760
We are working, we got the Popcorn to edit videos online ...

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,313
we got Thimble, to teach people to edit the Web pages ...

55
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,096
Uh, what is that we have other ... ?

56
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,394
We do have a lot of things, i get back to you as we'll continue ...

57
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:44,922
There is Collusion, to try to spy on the spies ... Finally full of nice things

58
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:51,756
overall, we are at a nearly 600 employees, a little more now ...

59
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,606
but well i suppose it must not have exceeded the 700

60
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:59,522
well, something between 6 and 700 employees ...

61
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,520
Therefore, employees of Mozilla
And the volunteers ...

62
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:10,390
Personally, before being employed by Mozilla, i was part of the Mozilla community, I was one of the thousands of volunteers.

63
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:13,298
I am not the only one in this room not more ...

64
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,654
Uh, why is it that there are volunteers?

65
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:22,409
Hey well because Mozilla, prior to be any other thing, it is a movement of substance.

66
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:31,150
Mozilla, it is a non-profit association which, admittedly, owns a company whose role is essentially to pay its 600 employees

67
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:40,677
but, therefore, this non-profit association has for unique vocation to defend the users of the Web.

68
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:45,365
So I insisted on the non-profit, a lot of people are not aware of it ...

69
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:54,785
among all manufacturers of browser, we are the only ones to be uh, the only people whose goal is really to defend the people.

70
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:58,889
It is really our first, second, third, unique objective.

71
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,022
well, I am speaking to you to defend the web, to defend the people on the Web ...

72
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:11,787
Just so we agree, I would like to tell you what it is that for me or can be for us the Web.

73
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,128
I will not make you a course on how it works, I am counting on you to already have an idea, if not ...

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,674
you will find the information yourself.

75
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:29,624
But I will give you a few examples of what may be the Web at its best, under his best glory.

76
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,034
The Web ... well the Web it is Wikipedia ...

77
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,058
not that Wikipedia is much ...

78
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:45,445
but the Web, it is a way of sharing of knowledge, Wikipedia it is a effort, of new, non-profit, full of people who have put together ...

79
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:50,623
some who have given 5 minutes, others who have given the months and months, others who are full time ...

80
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,903
to share all the knowledge of the planet.

81
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,830
Then, Mozilla has nothing to see there, let's be clear ...

82
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:04,806
But we found it nice and This is the kind of thing which was not really possible before the Web.

83
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,782
And if the Web disappears that is the kind of thing that will may be more possible.

84
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,322
This is the kind of thing one wants to defend.

85
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,285
It is not only that

86
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:20,518
Therefore Wikipedia, it was already getting together, another example of people being put together for other reasons, it is Github ...

87
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:30,821
It is the people ... well Github itself it is a tool that is used only to the people to work together across the planet.

88
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:35,523
Put in common their efforts for manufacture, we hoped, for the manufacture to make good things.

89
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:40,100
There is certainly plenty of disasters that come out of Github but, once from time to time, there is a great thing.

90
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,912
And it also this is the sort of thing that we wants to protect.

91
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:48,635
Again, Mozilla has nothing to do with Github ... well we used Github we even for some projects ...

92
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,985
but, uh, this is absolutely not that we launched Github.

93
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,181
Facebook.

94
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:56,124
We loved, or not.

95
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:01,922
I personally, I am not a huge fan but facebook is also something of very impressive.

96
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:07,041
Facebook, what is it? Facebook is once again people who are put together to communicate.

97
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:14,430
Once again, Facebook a tool, if there weren't the Web, Facebook wouldn't be here.

98
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:23,745
Google, well I am not going to continue my catalog forever but you'll see why I am showing you this example here.

99
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,199
Google.

100
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:31,017
A service, which is not supplied with the Web, that is to say the Web existed before Google ...

101
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:37,852
If Google disappears, the Web, will continue to exist but this is a very useful tool to find information.

102
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:42,693
And it try to force us to install Chrome by the way, as you can see ...

103
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:48,875
but oh well it remains very useful.
Therefore, Google ...

104
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:56,133
Why is it interesting? It is really this aspect "this is not provided with the Web".

105
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,106
They had not invented the Web, they arrived after the Web.

106
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,967
And yet, it is very useful that is even the hint the most used on the Web.

107
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,104
well.

108
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,243
The news also are important.

109
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:14,594
The site paper Mediapart, why paper Mediapart?

110
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,620
well, this is an online newspaper, there are hundreds of online newspapers ...

111
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,325
This is a log only online which has the characteristic, among other things, of having uh ...

112
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:26,684
It is them who have launched the case Bettencourt.

113
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:33,041
Therefore, that is an example of Web which has an influence on daily life.

114
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:40,202
At the time or, uh, say it a few months ago, there was the presidential elections.

115
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:43,770
It is quite probable that the case Bettencourt has played a mini role at least.

116
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:51,339
The Web, this is not just in computers, the Web is something that has an effect on the human life.

117
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,506
The Web has consequences on daily life.

118
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,106
I will come back a little later ...

119
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,583
well, it is not required to have consequences on the lives of all days.

120
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,503
It can also be fun to "Frager's" his mates also.

121
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,091
It is always a nice feeling of "Frager's" his mates.

122
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,465
A student: it has consequences on daily life ...

123
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,231
Frager's his mates?

124
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,811
Ah if it is angry with them, ya but.. <rires>

125
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,927
Another student: it can make people deaf, I've seen this in the log ...

126
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,892
<lol>
well, uh ...

127
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,261
The real world, it is also that.

128
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:36,390
this is several pictures of the Arab spring, which took place there was a time not so long ago, and that may not be quite done elsewhere.

129
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,107
Why is it that I speak to you of the Web for the Arab spring?

130
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,404
The Arab spring, the arab spring it was not the web.

131
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,297
The Arab spring, it was of the men and women who are gone face rifles.

132
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:52,921
Which in some countries have been successful, in other countries have not yet succeeded, in other countries are likely to be done completely explode ...

133
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,478
who have risked their lives, some of them who have paid with their lives.

134
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,607
this is not the Web, this is the real world.

135
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:06,404
Right now the Web has had an effect there above, the Web has been the tool, one of the tools they have used to communicate between them.

136
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:12,625
Without the Web, it would most likely be done as well but even so the Web has been a key tool in there.

137
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:23,800
Therefore, when I tell you that it is necessary to protect the Web and we want to protect the Web is that it would be nice if this kind of thing will continue to be possible with the Web of tomorrow ...

138
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,753
Then, of course, there the arab spring, it has already taken place.

139
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,205
It is not necessarily quite finished but it has already taken place.

140
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:40,152
I cannot tell you what is needed tomorrow, I can not tell you what will be important for humanity tomorrow.

141
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:44,245
May be that will pass through the Web may be not, we know not.

142
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:49,317
Now, given the importance that took the Web in our daily life, it is not impossible at all that it passes through the Web.

143
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:56,901
One of our goals at Mozilla, it is sure that we will not limit ourselves completely ...

144
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,586
that we will not put ourselves in a situation where the Web can be locked to prevent something important to happen.

145
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:08,764
A student: When you talk about to lock the Web, how do we protected it?

146
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,253
I will give some examples later.

147
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,593
But, if I have not answered your question at the end, ask there me, ok?

148
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:21,718
Yes, uh, pardon me, he asked: "What is it that I wanted to say by lock the Web and by protecting the Web"

149
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,464
Then, it has happened already of things on the Web.

150
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,918
There was something that was called the "browser war".

151
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:36,339
There was the 1.0 , 2.0 , and may be the 3.0 , oh well ...

152
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,492
After it's fun to give the numbers but ...

153
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:44,178
The war of browsers, I trigged it back, in fact, at a little before the beginning of the browsers.

154
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:51,375
Have you experiment this kind of thing in the mailbox?

155
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:03,558
... The frisbee, the magnificent frisbee that one received.

156
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:11,165
Several times per day, I got them in high school but really several times a week, we were approached to be distribute at the school yard of the high school.

157
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:12,696
I got them in my mailbox.

158
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:15,333
Some of them were provided with all the magazines that I read.

159
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:18,910
It was easy to redesign your flat at a certain time.

160
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,939
Apart from that, I have not found the interest from those frisbee.

161
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,405
In the case, I imagine that if they did, it is that they were there an interest.

162
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,862
Therefore, that, what I have given you here, it is from those of America Online.

163
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:38,760
Therefore, there were a number of services at the time who were modish, which in fact, began before the Web, hein, some of these services, not before the Internet.

164
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,093
Internet, it dates from the 60s.

165
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,835
But the Web, overall, it is 93s.

166
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:58,142
Therefore, there were services, like America Online, Compuserve, there is a certain service which was called MSN, Microsoft Network which has been added to it in 1995 therefore the Web already existed but was not yet to the extent that it currently has.

167
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,899
And what were those things?

168
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,813
It was of things which were much more powerful than the Web of the time, we will be clear ...

169
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:09,878
Who were much more powerful than everything that existed that, overall, could be found easily reached via in any case at the time.

170
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:13,449
Therefore at the time actually there was the Web that was difficult to access yet.

171
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,339
There was the BBS, it is mainly these two things there.

172
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:20,504
There was the minitel, well .... it was very convenient but a bit limited -

173
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,345
but that was a much more advanced technology.

174
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:26,970
I am not talking about the cakes themselves, I spoke of what they provided access.

175
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:31,002
The frisbee, it is always funny, it's into the category "Frager's his friends".

176
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,718
What is the difference with the Internet?

177
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:36,753
well, there are a plenty.

178
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:41,239
One of the differences is that it was unique sources.

179
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:48,483
If you want to make a page "AOL", at the time, they gradually liberalised as they lost the ground ...

180
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:55,955
but, to the great time, when AOL was so powerful that they could wrest when even almost a film studio.

181
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:05,104
At this time, you want to make a page AOL, where i know more exactly how they call it, I think that was an AOL service.

182
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:06,984
he had to pay AOL.

183
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:10,003
It was the agreement of AOL, it needed a contract with AOL.

184
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,267
Such with Compuserve, such with Microsoft.

185
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,507
Yes, therefore, fair history that there is no ambiguitees, MSN, they reused the name for something else.

186
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:31,606
The MSN which you have access to "chatter" these days, so here goes, this is a commercial heir but any technological infrastructure between time was resold, in this case France Telecom i think.

187
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,659
At least in France ...

188
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:42,124
To connect to any these tricks here, ah it is very simple hein, you have the pancake, you have the frisbee, you put it in your computer.

189
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:45,627
well, the frisbee does not exist in Linux version therefore that is ...

190
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:48,093
If you are under Linux, you will not connect.

191
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:51,522
According to the times, if you are on a Mac, you can connect or not.

192
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:58,417
Because it depended on how they wanted to break the head to make software for Apple, finally for the Mac.

193
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,675
If you say if under BSD they had never heard of you so it was not even the death of you break the head.

194
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,915
|Stupor among some students|
Under BSD.

195
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,253
well, you not more than you had not heard about it, this is not serious ...

196
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,633
The kernel of your Mac, it is the BSD, but well ...

197
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:31,047
Once you were with AOL, so either you were content, either you were not content ...

198
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:35,667
If you want to go to Compuserve or other, ok you could ...

199
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:42,381
simply, you lost your email, all of your email messages that you have stored, you may lose your address ...

200
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:48,362
And that is, you lose all your data what, you may lose even your "high score" in the games that were on-line..

201
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:54,123
No, it is very convenient for AOL ... or for Compuserve or for Microsoft etcetera ...

202
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,603
What was already a question and I will tell you the refit a number of times it is:

203
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,280
who owns the data?

204
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:06,099
Then, legally i do not know to which they belonged at the time, but in practice she belonged to the person that you file the galette.

205
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:14,172
Therefore, you might ask me what it was something not open ... that for example, it is not open.

206
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,545
This is not the only example that I will give you but that is the kind of thing against which ...

207
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,459
We both like fight!

208
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:25,736
Then, I am telling you this but this is absolutely not we who fight against that at the time.

209
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,282
I was a kid at that time.

210
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,743
The Web has developed at about the same time.

211
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:38,972
AOL already existed at the end of years 80, can be even in the mid-80s, Compuserve also.

212
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:43,260
MSN it happened in the years 90, the Web also happened in the years 90.

213
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:48,183
There are three browsers which are almost arrived at the same time.

214
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:53,897
Netscape, Internet Explorer who was not of Microsoft at the time, and Opera.

215
00:18:55,827 --> 00:19:00,367
The technology of the time, depending on the number of criteria of today, we must admit that she was completely rotten.

216
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:03,742
It was just a little bit of page layout and links.

217
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,256
And it was everything that we could do.

218
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:09,962
What has not prevented Netscape to assert that one was revolutionizing the world and that they were going to do the Web appliations.

219
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,804
Therefore, it was rather the marketing side of Netscape who spoke of that, that the technical part.

220
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:21,118
That said, it had a few advantages, the source was completely decentralized.

221
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:26,878
There was not a company, with which he had to make a contract to be able to make a Web site.

222
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:35,606
In the same way, it was not particularly filter therefore possibly there may be difficulties in gaining access to information often depending on where you were.

223
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,950
Because the access to the internet was difficult, either because it had to find this information.

224
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:44,990
Now they are talking about at a time or the search engines were pretty traits compared to what has today ...

225
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,079
but it remained decentralized, it remained non-filter.

226
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:55,390
The protocols were open, so one of the precise effects of this protocol is that ...

227
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:03,078
you have a browser, you had tired because he stopped not to plant, you are using another browser that stationmaster probably about as much, but not on the same sites

228
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:06,468
by using the two, you get to see a little while.

229
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,341
And in this case, Opera was not bad at the time.

230
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,868
Opera is always very well in this case but Netscape was completely rotten.

231
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:17,471
I have the right to say so, it is the Mozilla suite to Netscape ...

232
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:23,753
The effect? the effect was that users were free.

233
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:35,491
I want to say, you are subscribed with machin, you wanted to you resubscribe with contraption, you don't lose ... if you were doing you would lose your email messages actually but you had medium to get them.

234
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:38,673
It had to be a bit technical but it was doable.

235
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,827
You have full access to the Web, whether it be by a supplier or by another, it was exactly the same ...

236
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:49,089
that is, it is still much better.

237
00:20:49,873 --> 00:21:00,620
well, for the question of who owns the data, at the time, to share the mail, it was so limited that y'had not really the question that arose and the mail, there was a way to recover it.

238
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:10,852
And then, one day, Microsoft has decided that Microsoft Network it would serve to nothing ...

239
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:16,783
must say that they had no choice given the number of subscribers they had and that he had to take stormed the Web.

240
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,399
Why is it that they decided to attack the Web?

241
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:23,017
Well, Netscape, it returns, he did not stop to say:

242
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:29,525
"Look there is a new generation of applications, it's called Web applications. The Web is the new operating system."

243
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:37,122
"We are going to do with the things that will walk, on Windows, Mac ... full of tricks ... "

244
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:40,175
well, at the time, it was completely out of the glassy

245
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:46,252
but, uh ... But it was well seen because that is the kind of thing that has eventually arrived and Microsoft,

246
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:53,192
we cannot accuse them of having seen come Internet long in advance but on this coup that they have well panics

247
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,821
and they said that we were absolutely to kill it in the bud.

248
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:04,725
The need to prevent this Internet open, free because commercially it was catastrophic for them.

249
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:08,646
If this kind of thing ever happen, it would mean that there will be no more reason to be in Windows.

250
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:15,034
Potentially, in the long term, if we are to believe the promises of Netscape, which were worth what they were worth, y'would have more need of Word.

251
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,342
Finally here is, it is the two ways in which Microsoft makes money, Windows, and Word.

252
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:29,352
Therefore, Microsoft has begun to do everything possible for the Internet or Microsoft Internet.

253
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,149
So what did they do?

254
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,491
well already they had bought Internet Explorer a little before.

255
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:39,770
Then, they have begun to deliver Internet Explorer with Windows.

256
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:45,052
So far, it is quite annoying for the competition but it is not a disaster.

257
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:54,133
The problem is that gradually they are set to hijack the standards a little to the left and right.

258
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,795
They have introduced things like ActiveX.

259
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:58,512
Do you remember of ActiveX?

260
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,833
Thank you.

261
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:12,615
Therefore, historically, ActiveX it was a hack.

262
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:17,049
I want to say, that was really a hack which was improvised by Microsoft to fight against Java.

263
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:23,995
Sun and Netscape together, they have started, a gimmick that was called Java, which was not great at the time.

264
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:30,999
I hear people criticizing on the current version, in any case at the time, it was really sluggish.

265
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:39,501
And Java, what was it? it was more or less than the promise of Netscape that was in the process to fill.

266
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:47,097
It was the applications that ran in the browser, which most of the time walk both ...

267
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:50,559
Whether you're on Macintosh or Windows or Linux ...

268
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,883
And Microsoft had not seen it all.

269
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:58,431
Thus they introduced ActiveX.

270
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:06,913
ActiveX, from a user point of view, it was great, it was a gimmick that is was loading very fast, which functioned automatically and which could do anything.

271
00:24:08,141 --> 00:24:15,725
From the point of view of the people who wanted to return to your computer, which was awesome, it was a gimmick that is was loading very fast, which worked automatically, and who could do anything.

272
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,164
What a coincidence!

273
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:26,665
ActiveX, so it was a hack. They took one of their technologies that they used to ... it was COM at the time

274
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:35,702
that served ... we will reuse the pieces of a program in another and there they said,

275
00:24:35,702 --> 00:24:40,449
"Ah, we are going to be able to use any program to the inside of Internet Explorer just after I downloaded"

276
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:46,401
therefore, for example, to write a program which, I know not, would erase your hard disk, it should be 5 lines of Visual Basic ...

277
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:58,941
put it in the Web page, should the compile before forgiveness, it was the most difficult part, so put that in the Web page and then add a link to say "go, we pray thee, launched me this magnificent application".

278
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:13,130
In addition, there is a beautiful quote, if my memories are good, from Steve Ballmer, the subject of ActiveX, when it was pointed out to him that the security it was when same ... finally it would have been not wrong to make a little bit of security ...

279
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:26,266
Uh, the citation is: "If the users have the choice between safety and watch the pigs dance on the screen, they will choose watch of pigs dance therefore that is what we will provide them".

280
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,706
Well, the people have had pigs dance on the screen ...

281
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,233
Then, why is it that ActiveX is annoying?

282
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:49,308
These security reasons, it also applies to the privacy i want to say, it was a little more than 5 lines to retrieve all your Outlook contacts or to add a hint to spy on everything that you were typing on the keyboard to retrieve your number of blue card, I finally, it was not the kind of technology ...

283
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:56,954
Therefore, it was already something ... uh, how it is said politically correct "couldn't care less about the mouth of the world" ?

284
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,134
Uh ... it was a little light from the point of view of Microsoft

285
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:11,618
well, another problem with ActiveX, finally it was found that it was an advantage but the other problem was that ActiveX only worked on Windows.

286
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:18,023
Because it was a binary program that was running since ... finally i do not know exactly. We downloaded a program, it runs it.

287
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:24,627
Therefore, it only worked on Windows, at the beginning the people on the other platform were not happy because they had much less functionality on the Web pages ...

288
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:28,590
Is it that they realize what they had escaped ... finally well.

289
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:34,611
It was a way to try to divert the Web standards.

290
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:40,753
And it has worked out very well, because as ActiveX, for businesses, it was great practice for example.

291
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:48,801
You'll have the component, I know not what, inventory management on the server that could be updated each time.

292
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:56,983
Users connect to the page "management of the inventory", download, without realizing it because it was not need to request the notice to users.

293
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:02,279
Therefore, telechargenet an application, l'utilisent ... if there is a need to update the application, it is updated automatically etcetera ...

294
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:10,456
It was very good for the businesses of the coup d'Ã©tat ... of the sudden, it was a catastrophe for the users but it was very good for the businesses.

295
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:19,225
And this is the kind of thing that have allowed gradually to Microsoft to recover a portion of the Web by transforming it into something other than the Web.

296
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:25,933
By transforming it into something of closed, something of owner, because to develop a ActiveX, it must not be fooled into ...

297
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:32,533
It had to be on Windows, to develop a ActiveX, we had to use the Microsoft compilers ...

298
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,855
So that was ActiveX, but y'had not that this kind of thing.

299
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:54,139
From a time, I think they are never really went to the act or so if they do, they have quickly past under the carpet because it was at the wrong time ...

300
00:27:54,811 --> 00:28:02,271
But they have begun to announce that Internet Explorer would contain Word, finally in any case contain a part of Word.

301
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:10,391
Because after all, the HTML, it was a very size limit, so put the display capacity of Word on the inside of the Web browser.

302
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:19,315
Of course, to use Internet Explorer, the blow he had to put this on the platforms in which there was Word therefore it had to be on Windows, etcetera, etcetera.

303
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:31,978
The specifications of Word, which were absolutely not public at the time, which were eventually partially published ... a few years after following a legal release.

304
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:42,253
The specifications for Word, just to locate, to see how easy it is to make something compatible with that, there was 6000 pages just on opening the file.

305
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:50,219
good luck courage to try to establish something ... to display something on another browser.

306
00:28:50,437 --> 00:29:01,231
Therefore, in re-integrating these technologies, which for the coup were completely confidential, I want to say how works Word is completely confidential or that she was completely confidential.

307
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:06,040
By integrating that to the browser, they have added features ... very well

308
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,162
Oh, or they may not have done ...

309
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,698
It was thought that they were going to do that but I don't know if he really did.

310
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:17,270
In short, they added functionality to the browser and they prevented more and more use of technologies which were not their.

311
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:26,655
But it was in the process toward a world in which to browse the Internet you had to be in Windows, the need to use Internet Explorer.

312
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:31,347
To write a Web page he had to use Word and only Word.

313
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:39,410
To make interactive programs on a Web page, we had to use a Microsoft compiler so it still lacked one or two components ...

314
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:49,384
But microsoft was beginning to check not evil of things at the same time and there is another hint beautiful that they have begun to introduce, from memory it was at the same time, but I am not mistaken, this is ...

315
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,297
Uh, i do not know how they called at the time and finally it was a form of DRM in our days, that is ...

316
00:29:55,297 --> 00:30:09,509
Of the things that allow you to cancel the documents to distance therefore, their scenario that is "oh, I have sent by accident in the world, finally to the entire enterprise the file of accounting, hop i am going to do a manipulation to that nobody can read it".

317
00:30:11,674 --> 00:30:13,140
And, there had really been of pubs there above.

318
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,666
I think it was an elephant who had done "or there, I sent the whole accounting"

319
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,756
uh, ouai they were ridiculous these pubs but it is not serious ...

320
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:31,976
Therefore, this was a way to act at a distance, and more on the Web pages, on this which replaced the Web pages ...

321
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:46,419
In addition to this, in your Web pages, there were, in your Word documents excuse me, there was plenty of information that you did not put you same, information on your computer, the information on your behalf, etcetera ...

322
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:50,462
It began to do something ... if you start to look at it all of sudden ...

323
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:59,127
It was therefore a single enterprise that controls all of the technology and who puts full information ... who is going to do filter your information without asking your opinion.

324
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:09,109
Who has the technology either to cancel the things that you have published, either to let other people cancel the things that you have published ...

325
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:21,140
Because what I haven't told you is that the technology was supposed to go further, according to them, according to their pub. I have not checked to see if it was really the case, but "ah, here or there, this file violates my copyright, want here is a way of the cancel to distance".

326
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:28,130
It is not quite AOE'like. But it is a little sketchy as Internet ...

327
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,959
One of the consequences, this was not the only, it was a growing customer base in captive.

328
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:40,365
Therefore we could see the developments of Internet Explorer which went in this direction.

329
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,727
Internet Explorer 3 was probably the best browser at the time.

330
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:51,083
Internet Explorer 5/6 it started to be a little more ... heavy.

331
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:58,205
For the safety, overall this is we would prefer to see pigs dance than it is to make the security.

332
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:03,393
From time to time they had of security operations but it was rather sell of the security or the appearance of security.

333
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,539
So it was in an Internet where the user came in last.

334
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,747
This is not this, personally, this is not what I want for the Internet.

335
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:20,399
I showed you at the beginning what I wanted to for the Internet and that is the contrary. Therefore does it response to your question?

336
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:32,259
And still the problem of information, to which they belong from the moment a company may decide that your Web page no longer exists ... I do not know.

337
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:34,629
But the question is ...

338
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:44,785
So, that is, this world here, so I don't know if you are unable to read what y'a mark on the barricade that is "This is really closed".

339
00:32:46,587 --> 00:32:50,880
This world here then is it that with this Web there could have been Wikipedia?

340
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,651
Technologically, it was possible ...

341
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:04,874
But Microsoft had its own encyclopedia which was called Encarta

342
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:16,626
therefore from the time when Microsoft had its own encyclopedia, as Microsoft controlled everything, I do not know if it would have really been in the interest of Microsoft to let another encyclopedia begin to gain in popularity.

343
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:24,284
From the moment they were proficient all technologies, it was not necessarily very difficult to destroy Wikipedia in the bud.

344
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:28,629
Github.

345
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,860
I remind, Microsoft has a hint which is called SourceSafe ...

346
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:39,245
Yes, yes, it still exist ...

347
00:33:39,823 --> 00:33:41,897
There are still people who are suffering with this kind of thing.

348
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:55,988
Such, from the time where they had a product, why is it that they would have allowed a hint competitor in more free and in part based on free software.

349
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,629
Why is it that they would have allowed this breed to develop?

350
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:03,485
Facebook.

351
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:13,654
In this case, I do not guaranteed that they had a valid competitor to facebook but assume that they might not have been, very well.

352
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:18,544
Someone, say Marc Zuckerberg or someone else, launched ahah, I am going to make facebook.

353
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:23,025
He began to have 1000 users, 10,000 users, 100,000 users, 1 million users.

354
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:31,669
One day, a lawyer from Microsoft will happen, it is a completely hypothetical scenario, a lawyer from Microsoft therefore arrives:

355
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,777
"Hello, you are going to buy, that is, it is ac or you sank"

356
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:40,807
enough that it pulled the plug and facebook stopped to operate.

357
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,856
Therefore, Facebook was to have existed in condition to be Microsoft Facebook.

358
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,081
Or otherwise they would have launched their own facebook and they would have sunk.

359
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,645
Finally, I mean, it is the same.

360
00:34:54,579 --> 00:35:04,325
From there, all the tools that were used to communicate during the Arab spring, is-what they could exist in this form where under another?

361
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:14,767
Microsoft, a priori, i have no reason to assume that they are particularly hostile to anyone, finally to share their commercial competitors.

362
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:18,671
But suppose, in the shadow of a moment, that Microsoft has contracts with Ben Ali.

363
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:26,753
Or with someone in the family Ben Ali, which in this case is quite likely because to have contracts in Tunisia at the time, it was necessarily have contracts with the family Ben Ali.

364
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:35,231
Therefore, let us assume for a moment, if it was they who would be found in a position to control all communications.

365
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,887
All communications in Tunisia, it could be another country ...

366
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,291
What is it that they would have made Microsoft?

367
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:49,223
Because their commercial interests would have clearly been to cut the communications.

368
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:54,814
This is not a situation that you would like to see.

369
00:35:55,325 --> 00:36:10,419
When I tell you that one is fighting for an open Web, is that we want to avoid this kind of situation or a person, business, for commercial or other reasons, would have the possibility of, such as, cut the plug.

370
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:23,385
well, when to know of what we will need tomorrow in the framework of the Web, I still do not know the answer, I do not know what will be needed.

371
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:31,323
But, what I can tell you is that if there is only one company that controls everything, there is strong chance that it will not be ready for tomorrow.

372
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:37,748
Then there was the second browser war ...

373
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,884
Therefore, I do not know if ...

374
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:52,502
I do not think you have said but you may be aware, with this kind of manipulation, Microsoft is happening in a situation of total domination, Netscape has miserably casting.

375
00:36:52,948 --> 00:36:55,950
It remained Opera which was a bit of resistance in a corner.

376
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,159
It is our competitors but it likes Opera.

377
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,361
Seriously.

378
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:02,860
They are often good tricks.

379
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:09,510
well, during a time, it was say that is Internet will resemble to Microsoft Internet.

380
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:26,225
Fortunately, a small group of faithful irreducible who were 10, 10 veterans of Netscape. With a funding which in this case came from America Online, have launched Mozilla. And with the source code for Netscape also ... have launched Mozilla.

381
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:34,560
It took a few years for Mozilla to gives something but well Mozilla ended up to the situation that we have currently.

382
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:40,915
A situation where Internet Explorer is no longer the force that allows you to dominate the entire Web.

383
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:45,513
We are asked frequently, is it that you try to be number 1?

384
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,757
The answer is not.

385
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:53,635
Finally I want to say, it is fighting for the most of market share as possible but our main goal is not to be number 1.

386
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:58,065
Our main objective is to prevent someone to be in a position of total domination.

387
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:02,026
If ever we find ourselves in a position of total domination, there will be thought ...

388
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:04,967
But I think that can't happen.

389
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,932
There is enough competition to our days.

390
00:38:10,843 --> 00:38:12,669
Therefore, what is that we have done?

391
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:18,320
Therefore, once again, Mozilla, Opera and a few other much more anecdotal ...

392
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,895
Has been reintroduced the opening on the Web, the open standards ...

393
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:30,370
In such a way that any Web page written may be used with a browser, market also with another browser.

394
00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:38,287
That wasn't enough, there was that the technology caught up with this that allowed it to do the proprietary standards.

395
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:43,399
But in our days, we have open standards, a powerful technology ...

396
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:50,249
You can always watch the pigs that dance on the screen, everything is going well but a priori, we can look at the pigs that dance on the screen without take a virus.

397
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:53,895
Admire the progress of 10 years of technology!

398
00:38:55,565 --> 00:39:01,996
In our days, almost everything is compatible to a browser to the other, it always remains full of imperfections.

399
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:09,695
But almost all of the sites, in any case the people who take the time to make their Web site, arrive to make Web sites that work perfectly with the browsers.

400
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,910
This even includes Internet Explorer ...

401
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:25,383
Because Internet Explorer, therefore, after the calamitous versions 5 and 6, after the version 7, which was just a way to save time because they saw the versions of Mozilla and Firefox that did not stop to improve.

402
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:28,455
The version 7 that was basically to say "but if, but if, it is made of new versions".

403
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:31,740
The version 8 it is "if, if, it will get by to correct our bugs".

404
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:36,539
The version 9 well, it is the one ... it was reopened, there is it was a browser.

405
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:39,540
Uh, I have not tested the 10.

406
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:49,825
In our days, overall, I will not go so far as to say that everyone is over friendly and is typed in the back but we are in a situation where we can breathe.

407
00:39:50,572 --> 00:40:05,799
We are in a situation where this technology is sufficiently powerful, but also open enough and sufficiently standardized so that the people are not verouilles with a browser, a provider of access, a provider of tools to make the Web pages, etcetera, etcetera.

408
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,267
And in addition it won from the security at that price ... we lost the image but it was won of the security.

409
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:31,427
well, i do pretenderais not that the situation is perfect because for the questions of who owns the information, do you have a totally open access, the questions of the style HADOPI.

410
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:41,525
HADOPI, if taken with, may be, a little bit of bad faith, it is "or there, I look at something that I did not have the right to look at, ah of the sudden i no longer have the right to watch other choses" ...

411
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:44,939
Not a bowl.

412
00:40:46,017 --> 00:41:05,535
The things of the style ACTA, i do not know if you have followed the misadventures of the ACTA treaty which allowed to any who is entitled to a country to make a complaint in another country and to have the full cooperation of the countries to hunt down the counterfeits therefore the counterfeits was beginning to look a hint that you do not have the right to watch ...

413
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:09,256
I have read the text, it is a disaster.

414
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:12,574
Fortunately, it has been blocked at the European Parlement.

415
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,303
Nice!

416
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:20,463
We won, we won!

417
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,581
well, I put a question mark, hein.

418
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:25,424
If we had won, uh ...

419
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,853
Oh, it would be nice.

420
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,891
In fact, it remains a little more work

421
00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:33,317
back on Facebook.

422
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,499
well, you want to do something with facebook.

423
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:44,635
The protocols, APIS, all that, we will say that it is quite clear.

424
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,885
For the content, want, it is centralized,

425
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:49,933
it reminds me of the things ...

426
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:53,513
Ok, there are Web pages and facebook pages.

427
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:04,128
The Facebook page, technologically are Web pages, but if you do not have a Facebook account, you do not have access to the Facebook page.

428
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:16,229
The source is filtered. Facebook is known for, from time to time, delete pages because ... I know not why m'enfin ... for hundreds of reason.

429
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:23,358
But typically "ah, i insulted Estelle Hallyday or i know not what", it was not on facebook Estelle Hallyday but well ...

430
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:29,861
The data on Facebook ...

431
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,774
Your data, they belong to who?

432
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:36,079
They belong to Marc!

433
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:48,690
The data, all of your data that you put on facebook, then y'a a few small paths to have the right to have access to a part of your data but overall, the data they belong to Marc.

434
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,576
Then not only ...

435
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,295
Oh ya, little story ...

436
00:42:53,295 --> 00:43:03,524
There are a few days ago, a member of the Mozilla community, I know not if you have seen go this link ... has purchased for $5 1 million facebook profiles, finally all the information on 1 million of facebook profiles.

437
00:43:04,522 --> 00:43:07,931
He believed that it was a spam, it has done so "ah, i will check out" ...

438
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:11,335
I don't know if there were photos, I have not checked.

439
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:24,958
But uh, that is, he did "oh, I will look at, what it is that this scam", so he paid $5, and he actually received 1 million facebook profiles which him arrived books on Excel files I believe, or something like that.

440
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:32,018
Therefore, the profiles, the password weren't there but got all the details of the user including the name, the mail, ....

441
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:36,195
Uh, i do not think that there was the facebook pictures because it was in the Excel.

442
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:49,116
And that is not facebook, to make it worst, which has sold the information.

443
00:43:49,116 --> 00:44:00,005
It is likely, then I am going to say, any set on facebook, any application, I have not seen who he was talking about but it is a Facebook application any.

444
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,283
I do not know which one.

445
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:07,214
I think that the guy who has purchased for $5 a million profiles does not know more than that but that is ...

446
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,069
It is a way of stealing information.

447
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:14,764
Therefore, not only the data do not belong to you but you do not know to which they belong, they belong to the entire world except to you.

448
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:16,289
This is awesome.

449
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,061
Small question by the way:

450
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:24,338
Facebook and others applications, how is it that they are earning money?

451
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:28,128
well agreement they often lose some, but when they earn, how they earn?

452
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:31,956
... The advertising, but still ...

453
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:42,499
Therefore, well, the truth is that one is forced to extrapolate because, it is not public information.

454
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:48,572
Therefore, there is at least one application which makes money by selling the information to anyone on the Internet ... for 5 $.

455
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:52,563
1 Million for 5 $, that not very profitable, it depends on how many people buy.

456
00:44:53,366 --> 00:45:02,431
Facebook, very probably, earned their money using targeted ads therefore the principle of the targeted advertising is ...

457
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:13,078
They have information on you, therefore according to the case, either they sell the information, or more probably, because in my opinion y'a plus to ... finally it is at the highest level as ...

458
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:18,982
They extract information from all your profile, with all your history, of all the conversations that you had.

459
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:24,896
They extract this information and they can deduce what you have ... what you will want to buy.

460
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:31,347
And therefore, they sell this kind of information mined on priori, probably, without your name.

461
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:43,467
Therefore in the form of targeted advertising so that on your screen is displayed a advertising for, I don't know, go see the next James Bond because you talked about secret agent with someone.

462
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:54,208
well, I am speaking of the next James Bond, but y'a a case quite funny y'has something like 6 months in the United States.

463
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,339
It is an anecdote hein, this is not really a case.

464
00:45:57,476 --> 00:46:02,540
In a Tesco supermarket, perhaps in England and not in the USA, I may be wrong, finally well ...

465
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,838
The story remains the same.

466
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:12,474
Therefore a ... one of the commercial so it is not in the supermarket itself me finally brief, it is a supermarket chain Tesco.

467
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:24,625
One of the business receives a phone call from a gentleman who is extremely angry because his daughter of 15 years does not stop to receive advertisements for pregnant women.

468
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:29,789
And it is out of the question that she receive ads for pregnant women, it has 15 years.

469
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:34,387
Who has known, before the father, that the daughter was pregnant?

470
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,353
The supermarket.

471
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,088
Therefore, the girl was actually pregnant.

472
00:46:41,088 --> 00:46:48,059
The supermarket, looking at just its purchases and its loyalty card arrived to determine that she was pregnant.

473
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:54,588
it's only with a supermarket.
And in addition, it is legal.

474
00:46:55,774 --> 00:47:00,676
Now, Facebook, probably has much more information than your supermarket.

475
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:08,470
Facebook knows what you are talking about, with whom you talk to, when you speak, knows where you live globally, in any case from which you connect ...

476
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,023
What type of computer you have ...

477
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:22,326
In some countries, facebook knows what you are going to buy at the pharmacy, in any case they have signed a ... or maybe it is just in the parapharmaceutical forgiveness.

478
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:38,765
They have signed, there is 3 week, 1 month something like that, an agreement with a string of loyalty card which especially if busy for loyalty cards in the chain ... I never know if it is CVS or CSV, so who is a string of parapharmaceutical products in the United States .

479
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:41,517
That is ...

480
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:44,252
The private life, this is awesome.

481
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:47,916
Therefore, facebook can now determine if you are in therapy, or things like that.

482
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:57,671
Go, another question to the passage. Uh, I am talking about facebook but it is worth also for the competitors. Let us be clear!

483
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:03,072
well y'in has not on the scale of facebook of competitors, it is true, but well ...

484
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,731
Go, question to the passage: that am the button "Like" that I have seen plenty of blogs, full of Web sites?

485
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:13,632
Therefore, I am being quoted "It spying on us", but still ...

486
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:21,470
I heard a piece of voice by there may I have not had time to see who it was.

487
00:48:29,524 --> 00:48:31,952
And then, potentially also ...

488
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:35,337
But I was just on the party spying context in ...

489
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:44,380
The button "Like", it appears on your screen, sends information about your navigation among Facebook.

490
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:49,965
You do not need to click on it, that the button is displayed.

491
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:52,948
well y'a of the javascript behind, y'a of things behind.

492
00:48:53,404 --> 00:48:57,782
There'a a iframe, brief always is that he comes to determine who you are.

493
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,420
It is cool, eh?

494
00:49:01,477 --> 00:49:09,422
Therefore, if you have a Facebook account, to priori they need not more than a few milliseconds to make the link between the identity of the two persons.

495
00:49:09,422 --> 00:49:17,467
If you do not have a Facebook account, it can still realize that it is the same person who connects to such site, and then to such site, and then to such site, and then to tel site at that time from such a place etcetera, etcetera.

496
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:20,586
After doing such research by Google possibly ...

497
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,154
Nan, nan, it is not harmless this small "Like".

498
00:49:25,616 --> 00:49:28,336
Student: How it is done to know ...

499
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,554
Then it is a good question, how I am ...

500
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:40,623
Then me i have to know because I read somewhere ...

501
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:48,235
I can give you a case where i realized myself, it was by completing my taxes online.

502
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,551
I like the horror stories like this ...

503
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:58,852
Uh, i was in the process of debug a Firefox extension to this time and then i decided to pause and go fill my taxes online.

504
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:05,910
I still had all my tools of debugguage which was displayed and when i am connected to the taxes on-line, I saw full of information that are not going toward taxes.

505
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:08,056
But who went to a private company.

506
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:17,844
Then, I suppose, but I have no way to be sure, that they are just statistics to see how much time people spend on the site of taxes, to see if it is ergonomic and any.

507
00:50:17,844 --> 00:50:20,020
If people come back 1 million times on the same tabs or etcetera ...

508
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:24,138
In any case, since that day, I am not reconnected on the site of taxes on-line.

509
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:29,173
I have no idea but it is a good question.

510
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:30,730
I was asked if it was legal ...

511
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:39,062
Other intervener: In fact, there is a lot of techniques that allow you to target the behavior of people on a Web page.

512
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:42,863
It is the simple marketing ...

513
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:53,039
As we want to do client side ...

514
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:57,833
The good side of the hint is that you can watch what is happening in fact.

515
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:03,156
It has tools to debug in the browsers. Firefox, Chrome, Opera ... and we can look at the code that s'execute ...

516
00:51:03,156 --> 00:51:11,760
Therefore, a button "Like", I believe that a single button "Like", finally for us it is a nightmare to optimize side Gecko because it is more than 8 megabytes of memory going up in smoke.

517
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:18,716
Because it is an Iframe that contains an HTML document that contains a lot of JS to make a pack of things because that is the analysis.

518
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:22,647
it is used to see how the people interragissent between them.

519
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:35,099
What interested Facebook, it is to see, to have certainty in what you are interested when you navigate on the Internet. To know that, the subjects which are of concern to you, on which you spend the time it is uh ...

520
00:51:36,806 --> 00:51:43,402
I don't know, uh ... the products to combat "Zen" morning for example for the hint of any at the time.

521
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,006
It can be anything and everything.

522
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:52,105
their serves after to you hawk of the advertising which will be more targeted therefore who are going to be able to sell more expensive.

523
00:51:52,147 --> 00:51:54,455
Therefore, Facebook is a very very good example.

524
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:56,273
It is thought that it is the best to do that.

525
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:58,635
Technically, it is they who have the more surface area.

526
00:51:59,002 --> 00:51:59,688
But ...

527
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:03,621
Y'a not very long, even in France, y'a people strong enough to.

528
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:11,643
I have yet received, in the laboratory where it was hump all the two, the "UVA", y'a people who are trying to make something like that, to the facebook.

529
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:15,529
And, uh i think that there is on the site of the taxes.

530
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:19,479
that allows them to assess also sometimes the ergonomics of a Web site.

531
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:24,793
They are trying two versions of a Web site, with two different page layouts.

532
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:35,243
And they are trying to see what is the page on which the people remain the least long, on which the people arrive the most quickly to the final page.

533
00:52:35,243 --> 00:52:37,610
Therefore, in that ...

534
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:39,921
we will say that there are two possible attitudes to have:

535
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:47,263
the first, is to really say good, that by default it wants to remain a little suspicious on the information that you disclose online and ...

536
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:57,651
For the most curious, it is studied, this is the code which is analysis, which is running, which is debug very well in the browsers, we can see the queries that are past, one sees the information which are exchanged.

537
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:07,358
It was of the people among us, in the security team who spend their day at that, to study all these movements of information between your site, the small buttons trivial as on the Facebook site "Like" and other ...

538
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:14,255
And that we allow you to check after we, in Gecko, that it gives the least information as possible.

539
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:30,627
Typically, Firefox 16 that it has released y'2 weeks ago, he was arrested in disaster at the end of 2 hours because it is seen that there was a hint which would have allowed the button "Like" typically, to have your browsing history. Therefore, there clearly is not the case.

540
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:33,831
It was the 16.01 two hours later and was pushed across.

541
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:42,268
But, it is party of the things that ... that we can verify that because it runs in the browser.

542
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:54,603
Therefore, y'a of the browsers that have a clear interest to ensure a seal, it is going to say, between your private data and the Web, and other browsers which clearly have an interest in doing the opposite.

543
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:16,375
Then, the private browsing, a priori, will help you a little about that but will not be sufficient to prevent this kind of thing.

544
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:24,585
That is to say, a priori, when you are in mode "private browsing" it should not happen to ... facebook, once again, we cited facebook but it is the same for the competitors.

545
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:28,099
It is just Facebook, there is party on this name there.

546
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:36,247
Therefore, Facebook should not happen to link your profile with your navigation.

547
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:45,570
But in my mind, if you connect to two sites of affiliate during the same private browsing, he will realize that it is the same person.

548
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:47,283
I am wrong?

549
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:52,485
By contrast, y'a to other tools that I will briefly introduce ...

550
00:54:54,217 --> 00:55:05,742
In fact that, This is what is called the fingerprinting, if we want to know side, the side of the Web site that the same person has connected two times, it will seek to carry out tests to have ...

551
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:14,174
How to say, the characteristics of the browser which is used to try to be sure of the identity of the guy.

552
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:22,051
When one goes into private browsing, it is even more difficult when identifiable because it loses the history each time, to each private browsing.

553
00:55:23,802 --> 00:55:29,875
However, the risks of fingerprinting are more delicate but in theory you can always.

554
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:47,807
But we can even do it without javascript, the example which is known as the white wolf, this is the email messages in HTML, which often contain an image which is a transparent GIF of a pixel and that I think that all the businesses of marketing of the world are doing it,So what is the purpose of that?

555
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:59,032
their used is to connect the email messages to the entire earth and they know just by looking at the logs to connect to their Web server if this pixel of, a byte, to summer read.

556
00:55:59,032 --> 00:56:02,298
Is that the email address on which they have typed at random, y'a well someone behind.

557
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:06,066
So in fact, it can not uh ...

558
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:09,658
to share does not connect on the Internet, actually ...

559
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,122
We can not protect themselves completely with this kind of thing here.

560
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:27,488
You can be warned, people like you, who are educated to be the actors of the Web of tomorrow ... You can have it in mind for you ask in what direction technically you have to go to that in the long term, it remains master of our data as much as possible.

561
00:56:27,488 --> 00:56:31,130
But, clearly, there is no solution without it censorship.

562
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,550
It is the best we can and that is, y'a stuff more ...

563
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:43,196
I will show you some counter-measures but it is true that against the fingerprinting, it is very difficult to protect.

564
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:49,960
And y'had the test which had been performed, the fingerprinting, nothing that with the information that we really can not block.

565
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,813
Kind, the version number of the browser, the language in which you are, and your IP address.

566
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,721
Only with that we can identify people very well.

567
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:01,126
Yes, it is a scary thought.

568
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:19,124
well, I spoke to you on Facebook, I cannot do not hit on Google.

569
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,500
Therefore Google, which is nice.

570
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:31,266
Now, Google is not just a search engine, it is all a galaxy of services, including Google Docs, Google More, finally Google everything you want ...

571
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:34,610
Google Shampoo, it should not yet exist but well ...

572
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:38,470
Therefore, Google, more and more, has of the centralized content.

573
00:57:40,322 --> 00:57:50,543
May-be not technologically centralized because they have data centers in the world but if you have a document that you share on Google Docs, well it is at Google, it is not among you.

574
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:55,682
Still, Google are not the worst of this point of view but must still maintain that in mind.

575
00:57:57,312 --> 00:58:05,655
A certain place, they have sources ... then it is a little different but finally well ... at least on Google More Than y'has the same problems as on Facebook overall.

576
00:58:06,632 --> 00:58:09,114
And there'S always the problem, to which belong the data.

577
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:16,360
If you look at the license of a little almost all Google services, once you turn the tips online at Google, it belongs to Google.

578
00:58:16,652 --> 00:58:18,754
it probably belongs to you also oh well...

579
00:58:18,754 --> 00:58:27,691
You have your plug of tax that you have filled, finally your Excel file with your accounts that you have filled on Google Docs, it belongs to them also.

580
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:30,454
They guarantee you just that a human being is not going to read.

581
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:34,426
They do not guarantee that a program will not read that, because they guarantee you even that programs will read it.

582
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,176
They don't tell you what the programs are going to do.

583
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:42,405
Therefore, how is it earning money, Google?

584
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:48,034
Answer, in exactly the same way that Facebook by being just a little more transparent on this subject.

585
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,731
No, that is true.

586
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:54,793
Google i want to say, in the category Lord of Darkness, we have seen worse than Google.

587
00:58:55,635 --> 00:58:57,736
But oh well to do gaffe.

588
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:03,432
We have seen worse, but that doesn't mean it must accept almost everything.

589
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:06,283
A student: You can give an example worse?

590
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:09,542
Worse than Google? Microsoft y'a few years ago

591
00:59:18,233 --> 00:59:24,468
I will think about it
But I will not give examples ...

592
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:31,947
well, let us take this words, without any report with the conversation that has just taken place, what is happening on the iPhone

593
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:38,540
Therefore, again, develop on the iPhone it is easy.

594
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:41,812
The contents of the iphone just full of place.

595
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:47,287
That is to say, the Apple appstore. And that is all

596
00:59:48,091 --> 00:59:51,152
you have not the right to install applications that do not come from the appstore in the iPhone

597
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,477
You...

598
00:59:56,173 --> 01:00:00,232
We do not have the right, I talk about us because we(Mozilla) have a experience with that.

599
01:00:00,652 --> 01:00:03,615
In general, you do not have the right to put any application on the app store.

600
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,916
They have a right to refuse for the overall head of the client.

601
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:18,330
Therefore it is happened hein, i would say there is a clause which has been added to their reason to refuse. It is by and large, if it is written by adobe, they (apple) in wants to not

602
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:34,938
It been writing almost as such in their clause. They do not want to adobe, they really want to give a kick to adobe, they gave a kick to adobe. The terms of the apple appstore they change when they want. And they have made abundantly clear.

603
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:37,860
Therefore another example that directly affects us.

604
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:44,328
It is that you do not have the right to make a browser for iPhone which is not safari makeover.

605
01:00:45,276 --> 01:00:46,256
And slower

606
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:54,804
And so it is true, it must be slower. A browser, but non-chrome is much slower than Safari on the iPhone, it is almost 9x slower.

607
01:00:57,417 --> 01:01:01,450
Opera i always ask myself the question. Opera .. They have a special version

608
01:01:02,688 --> 01:01:08,747
The opera mini still, I think that it is a safari on the top and a special trick ...

609
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:10,346
Opera returns of images.

610
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:14,608
"Opera is almost as an image viewer for image "

611
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:16,519
Opera mini that is it is not a true browser

612
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:22,966
" and the navigation, finally the construction of the page is made on a server of opera, so uh...

613
01:01:22,966 --> 01:01:26,406
They do it since the night of time. On phones lowercase.

614
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:29,865
And it works very well.

615
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:34,271
It is a little surprising that they want to do so on a powerful device as the iphone.

616
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,604
But obviously there are people, ... situation on which it works well.

617
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,571
And uh the reason for which the other terminals ... browsers are more slow.

618
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:52,335
It is quite simple. Is that in made you are obliged to use the bricks ios, in the bricks ios there is the engine webkit which is common to chrome and safari.

619
01:01:53,283 --> 01:01:59,406
But the acceleration of the javascript is reserved only to Safari.

620
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:09,116
Therefore we can do any other browser. A condition that he used
The same rendering engine as Safari and Chrome. That therefore the extensions

621
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:20,506
that are more and more owner, they have added to the syntax
HTML,CSS, ... sometimes in expectations of standardization, sometimes not at all.

622
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:28,451
They reinforce these positions there. But while doing so, they make it so
That if you made another browser, it will be slower. And it must be the genius

623
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:36,585
of the engineers from google to give the impression that their browser is
Faster then that actually on the benchmarks it is 9x slower.

624
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:40,737
But this is the difference between the perception of speed and actual speed.

625
01:02:41,886 --> 01:02:54,833
And that is, it is very impressive. The day or Google Chrome is output for IOS, there are plenty of people who said ouaa is great it is so much faster than Safari. And all the benchmarks were saying that it was 9x slower.

626
01:02:54,833 --> 01:03:08,595
And yes, this is ... everything you been said at the moment, the javascript component on IOS. It is prohibited another javascript component than that provided by Apple.

627
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:15,094
And that is provided by Apple there is a small flag "accelerate or not accelerate " and there is that Safari which has the right to accelerate.

628
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,877
It deserves to be simple.

629
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:43,323
It is of limited functionality artificially in a purely commercial objective, purely to ensure the domination of a product on the other, purely to ensure that the tricks owners dominate the Webkit web

630
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:47,768
I not conceal from you that it is a bit there ...

631
01:03:51,255 --> 01:03:54,954
For the data this is not very clear

632
01:03:56,201 --> 01:04:00,674
I have to confess that I have not followed or in icloud is and all that surrounds him

633
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,693
but you...

634
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,715
Personally i have no iPhone or other

635
01:04:05,123 --> 01:04:11,387
If you have an iPhone I invite you to check the licenses on to which belong the data, and where they are.

636
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:16,985
For a lot of something there is no transparency.

637
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:23,904
Therefore this history on the versions of javascript been slow and so on, at very least we know.

638
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:27,579
What is there is other that we do not know? Bottom by definition it is not known.

639
01:04:28,253 --> 01:04:33,759
The history of the iphone which recorded your movements, it is not known why.

640
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:42,391
Therefore according to Apple i do know more than what have been their explanations... due to a bug ( ...) it is possible I do not know any more.

641
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:46,245
The usage statistics for the network, it is possible.

642
01:04:46,245 --> 01:04:49,428
As there is no transparency, there is no transparency.

643
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:54,315
In addition there is a question that I asked on this subject.

644
01:04:54,315 --> 01:05:04,829
Apple has signed a certain time, 1 year or 2 an agreement with twitter, a specific agreement with twitter on the supply... the fact to provide identities.

645
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:08,951
Is it that someone knows what is in this agreement? I do not know

646
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:14,148
may therefore be that the information is available somewhere

647
01:05:16,657 --> 01:05:18,905
Personally If I had an iphone i have liked check.

648
01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:23,521
Therefore the situation and any of following better at google

649
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:35,387
At google the protocols are clear, it is easy to develop, the content there is on the market place

650
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:39,281
Uh pardon it is call google play now the market place.

651
01:05:40,475 --> 01:05:43,921
The contained, google may decide to transfer the things.

652
01:05:43,921 --> 01:05:47,623
They usually have not too much of a trend, so we already know a little bit.

653
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:54,527
When there is an IT professional, you can install applications elsewhere
That the market place, but unfortunately 99.9 % of the population on

654
01:05:54,527 --> 01:06:01,403
Earth is not monday-wednesday -therefore does not know how to do it. And do
Not take the risk even if he is told that he have to uncheck the option.

655
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:06,521
After there is a warning, caution you can install a virus. Therefore low yes yes it is true.

656
01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:07,663
No no but it is true.

657
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:16,133
So again there are a few limiters of artificial features. I do not know which of head but this is the same kind of thing.

658
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:20,807
I am telling you this but once again between android and IOS you prefer widely android.

659
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:22,557
Android is widely more open.

660
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:29,559
But it wants to by saying that he must keep it. But keep your eyes open on what it was.

661
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:35,422
Again to use your android you must have an account at Google.

662
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:45,033
You cannot start your phone or your tablet, or your fridge android if you do not have an account at Google.

663
01:06:46,104 --> 01:06:51,056
What are the information sharing between your fridge android and ... no, I think not that you have the fridge android.

664
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,943
well I am being quoted that may be so.

665
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:00,118
In any case there are televisions under android.

666
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:04,505
Therefore, there is probably the video recorders.

667
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:09,610
Whatever the hint that you have on android, it will share information with Google.

668
01:07:10,908 --> 01:07:13,322
Which i do not know.

669
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:17,497
Sure you can find the information somewhere, in seeking well.

670
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:24,918
But once again we sum in a situation where Google

671
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:31,990
The only reason for which is fact android. Aside from hitting Apple because it is important that kind of thing in life.

672
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:39,142
The only reason is to have information on you. Because once again it is how they earn money.

673
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,333
Therefore make blunder in this kind of thing.

674
01:07:42,912 --> 01:07:44,246
It has always been problems of transparency.

675
01:07:45,576 --> 01:07:48,143
That is what brings in the money again?

676
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,998
The more they have information on you, the more they earn money.

677
01:07:50,728 --> 01:07:52,382
It is a very simple equation for google.

678
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:59,366
It must be that i typed a little on chrome when even

679
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:02,443
I said of the well of opera, it is the friendly people

680
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:09,830
Chrome,... it is a browser very well that fact of tricks friendly

681
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:11,652
I will begin with that because it is true.

682
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:13,857
They are full of great stuff well.

683
01:08:16,386 --> 01:08:25,653
Where it begins to be much less nice is when they have in addition to the protocols of the web... protocols not quite web which is added.

684
01:08:26,265 --> 01:08:27,985
Therefore for example native client

685
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:35,630
i don't know if it is familiar to you, so it is active X better. It is active X with security in more.

686
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:45,480
Therefore I repeat google native client is something that allows a web page to contain an executable that will install it in your home.

687
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,575
And run among you.

688
01:08:48,635 --> 01:08:53,735
Now unlike active X there is a security. It is already a point well.

689
01:08:54,758 --> 01:09:04,413
Now the problem is that the executable, and bin you will have a executable ... i don't know for PC, you are going to use from your phone and down on your phone it won't work.

690
01:09:04,772 --> 01:09:07,763
It is no longer of any in the framework of the open web.

691
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:10,093
It is in the context of something locked

692
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:11,945
i am getting the sign that it is not quite true.

693
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:21,449
In made it is a little bit more complicated. But the NaCl, Native client google.

694
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:25,252
It is actually of the compiled code, there is a pepper and native client.

695
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:30,773
For native client, what they think they are going to do.

696
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:42,837
It is make the code as it is at the time ... i86 and the ARM code. And therefore they can imagine of the departure target 2 of types of materials.

697
01:09:43,905 --> 01:09:49,961
Knowing that even when the code that will run on your browser, it's going to be a big black box. We will not be able to have what is happening in that code.

698
01:09:49,961 --> 01:10:11,480
Unlike javascript code which all the rest is running on a web page and ... that is broken the web open with this idea there. And if one day they decide to stop to bear a machine or if one day there is a new hardware architecture which appears it will not take advantage of its development native client.

699
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:16,453
It is a road on which we Mozilla is committed on which there has been backsliding.

700
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:18,816
(... Do you have an example ?)

701
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:24,289
No, there is not really do very much to my knowledge, no

702
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:28,397
I know one who is call bastion which is a game in the Diablo which is not bad at all

703
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:41,143
it is for applications that can be active only from... Chrome market? Chrome Store

704
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:50,900
as it is google we do not know in advance what they will do.

705
01:10:51,174 --> 01:10:56,662
Google makes a lot of free software, in this case these software are free software.

706
01:10:56,662 --> 01:10:59,302
But it is not a transparent governance.

707
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:04,615
From time to time they announce a hint, which is totally coherent for a company to lucrative purpose.

708
01:11:09,994 --> 01:11:14,273
Our objective is not to keep the secret face of the competitor.

709
01:11:15,346 --> 01:11:17,618
It is not oblige to love

710
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:25,492
therefore to we it was these issues of centralized content, these applications ... let us take on the other side native client...

711
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:28,619
Ah yes just to complete, what has been said earlier.

712
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:32,491
There is NaCl and native client that are not exactly the same thing

713
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:40,895
this is not very clear, but one of them and more multiple platform than the other.

714
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,195
To summarize.

715
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:45,770
In all cases it is the publisher Google, which operates only on the chrome.

716
01:11:48,753 --> 01:11:50,219
Therefore there is a history of centralized content.

717
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:56,837
There is a market, ... they may have fallen over so take with a tweezers serious what I will tell you right now.

718
01:11:56,907 --> 01:12:09,017
But in any case there was a time when the web applications installable on Chrome and chrome os were only of web applications that came in from the Store or Google Chrome webstore

719
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:17,600
again we come back to the problem of the silo locked. That with android and especially ios

720
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:21,017
they have may be declined over this is not very clear in my head

721
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:24,877
once again, therefore I do swore not above.

722
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:28,820
Therefore this said it is a single source filter.

723
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:35,692
And then, one of my favorites with chrome and chrome os, but already with chrome it is ..

724
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,427
Why they have done a browser remember me?

725
01:12:40,236 --> 01:12:45,271
For exactly the same reason that for all the rest, for more information on you,

726
01:12:45,807 --> 01:12:47,928
because it is how they earn money.

727
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:55,286
So ... a huge difference between chrome and firefox, i will not go over the differences.

728
01:12:55,286 --> 01:13:06,307
But one of the huge differences, is that we with firefox is to protect your privacy including take choices which will limited the functionality of firefox

729
01:13:06,826 --> 01:13:11,596
The goal of google with chrome, it is recover the more possible information on you.

730
01:13:13,211 --> 01:13:18,084
By all means almost legitimate and feasible.

731
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:24,382
Therefore, an example beast, if you type an address or start a search on the search bar at the top.

732
01:13:24,536 --> 01:13:31,002
If you do a search, it will go in any case to Google, if you type in an address, Google is aware.

733
01:13:31,002 --> 01:13:34,328
That is to say that the information is not accurate on your computer, but also at Google.

734
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,462
Google knows by or you browse.

735
01:13:42,858 --> 01:13:48,660
The manner in which they cite as a feature, it is ... what they are doing a hint predictive thanks to that

736
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:54,960
as they know on what page you are and he knows your habits and that they are aware of the regulars, the people are almost the same thing as you.

737
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,892
They are able to download the following page on which you'll probably you connect.

738
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:01,020
But the information...

739
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,945
It is good to you apriori but the consequences is that they know what you are doing exactly.

740
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:18,230
The favorites, the contents of the forms that we send, I have no idea.

741
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:27,150
(If for example if there is a Google account, and it synchronizes with our browser... we can retrieve our favorites on another system)

742
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:31,355
(that is a choice that you did)
Then...

743
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:38,499
then I am told that actually, so I had not checked myself

744
01:14:38,543 --> 01:14:47,365
but I am told that google has the information, that the information on the favorites and everything that is on the forms therefore including the passwords.

745
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:52,168
Is a priori information associated with your Google account, and that he is moving from one browser to another

746
01:14:52,341 --> 01:14:55,761
when you go to a browser to another and therefore a priori at Google.

747
01:14:56,627 --> 01:14:58,516
Ok you me the learn.

748
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,987
I am told it is the same with Firefox, and the answer is not.

749
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,047
It was the feature, but it is encrypted with a key that we do not have.

750
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,753
All information are actually on our server, but it was not the key to decrypt the data.

751
01:15:13,993 --> 01:15:18,554
The coup if you lose your password, it is beast to you because you can not you make.

752
01:15:26,618 --> 01:15:30,252
Let us imagine a world dominate entirely by a silo, one of these things

753
01:15:31,202 --> 01:15:41,547
so that this is facebook, iphone, chrome in the version the most extremist as possible because once again they don't do that stuff extremist, they are hints very well at Google.

754
01:15:41,547 --> 01:15:44,963
So imagine a world dominate entirely by one of these things there

755
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:48,589
is-what wikipedia is possible?

756
01:15:50,753 --> 01:16:03,811
Yes, no, perhaps, I know nothing but say that it is quite tempting to imagine that if never facebook launched its own wikipedia in a world facebook

757
01:16:03,811 --> 01:16:06,905
down there would be exactly the same problem that I mentioned earlier.

758
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,185
It is the same for github.

759
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,958
Therefore is it could reinvent facebook by a world controlled by facebook?

760
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:17,391
Or is it that facebook could be reinvented in a world controlled by Google?

761
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:20,805
The answer is no, they have a competitor who is call Google +

762
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:22,726
It will not break the head

763
01:16:22,769 --> 01:16:28,079
if you rely on 100% of a provider, you can not make a company that is worth billions of dollars like facebook.

764
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,864
And there is no possibility.

765
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:35,289
And wishes for the games? You know Zinga?

766
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:39,863
So you knew Zinga, right?

767
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:45,095
Is it there are people who are not familiar with the history of Zinga and particularly the stuff arrived this week?

768
01:16:46,266 --> 01:16:47,779
Therefore there are several people so I am about to tell.

769
01:16:48,462 --> 01:17:02,059
Zinga is a company which is making games on facebook, there are still 1 year 1year and a half it was regarded as an extraordinary success, they had a budget of i do not know how many hundred of a million dollars

770
01:17:02,214 --> 01:17:03,792
it was a very impressive trick.

771
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:07,394
It is kind of small games sims city, farm town, something like that...

772
01:17:08,884 --> 01:17:11,413
Good very well

773
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:24,331
to summarize, here they have published a deficit of $52 million kind yesterday, something like that after you have transferred almost all the world and all the creative team is a party.

774
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,563
Therefore that is what happened between the two?

775
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:31,464
Is it that you know what has happened? What has caused the fall of Zinga

776
01:17:32,074 --> 01:17:33,620
(an agreement with facebook which has not market ?)

777
01:17:37,923 --> 01:17:41,265
may be there was also that behind, I do not know exactly.

778
01:17:41,265 --> 01:17:41,872
But...

779
01:17:43,773 --> 01:17:47,713
Facebook has changed a feature to annoy Zinga.

780
01:17:48,883 --> 01:17:50,582
Therefore I do not know if there was an agreement behind provided

781
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:53,854
it is not impossible that they have done well from the point of view of users

782
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:56,433
because obviously Zinga stopped not of spammer all users.

783
01:17:58,045 --> 01:18:03,367
So ... obviously to each time you ... I do not have all the details because I have never played the game.

784
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:05,533
If someone is ready to tell me I am ready to take.

785
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:09,776
But overall, facebook was advertising free to Zinga

786
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:13,336
how worked facebook, they were free of the pubilite has Zinga

787
01:18:13,536 --> 01:18:18,879
because each time that you spend a level, each time that you have retrieved 100 gold coins, or something like that

788
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,627
* cling *
All your friends were notify.

789
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:25,368
And so... Facebook to decided: "No, but it will not "

790
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,203
and they have decided to change the mode, finally changed facebook

791
01:18:29,546 --> 01:18:31,080
Zinga went from that to that

792
01:18:33,686 --> 01:18:37,050
so that is the danger of having a single supplier.

793
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:40,019
Zinga was a company which depended on to 100% of facebook

794
01:18:40,419 --> 01:18:42,037
and soon it will no longer be a business

795
01:18:45,204 --> 01:18:48,380
unless they arrive to find a great idea to change the course of the situation

796
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,216
but it's going to be damned evil part

797
01:18:51,187 --> 01:18:59,174
therefore this is a very simple illustration of , finally i you gave the hypothetical situations with wikipedia, github,... with Facebook

798
01:18:59,174 --> 01:19:04,308
This is a very practical situation that is currently under way.

799
01:19:05,293 --> 01:19:10,123
And again, I will talk to you about the Arab spring because this is an example that I like

800
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,616
because it is a good example

801
01:19:12,301 --> 01:19:19,634
if we were in a world entirely controlled by one of these companies, and that one of these companies had a contract with for example the family Ben Ali

802
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:26,736
is the communication would have been possible? Of course it can be assumed that not

803
01:19:30,728 --> 01:19:34,872
all this is the kind of reason for which we love combat life silo

804
01:19:35,009 --> 01:19:38,300
we call that a silos from the time or it is locked.

805
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:45,726
This morning when I took the RER i had put a transparent Silo = not well

806
01:19:45,983 --> 01:19:50,074
to be sure that everyone understood. That the stragglers to catch up.

807
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:55,177
But i'm told that it should be when not even insulting you.

808
01:19:56,218 --> 01:19:57,489
well

809
01:19:57,489 --> 01:19:59,328
What are the activities of mozilla inside it?

810
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,826
I spoke to you of full of people but very few mozilla

811
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:04,719
Therefore we have been fighting on several fronts.

812
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:09,487
I summary that in 3 fronts, this is not quite frankly not something as specific

813
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:13,857
one of the main fronts, it is therefore the struggle for privacy.

814
01:20:14,396 --> 01:20:26,878
We want the users therefore... have their own information and that when their data are used either with their agreement.

815
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:30,963
And not just because it is free and automatic

816
01:20:32,415 --> 01:20:37,418
We have a number of current project and a number of project which are in fact projects.

817
01:20:38,715 --> 01:20:42,362
In an attempt to make progress on this front is

818
01:20:44,642 --> 01:20:49,032
the first project is therefore the project Persona formerly browser ID,

819
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:51,976
they changed the name, because no one understood what that meant browser id

820
01:20:52,706 --> 01:20:55,311
i does not guarantee that people understand what wants to say Persona but at least it a good head.

821
01:20:57,410 --> 01:21:00,576
Therefore persona it is matters of authentications

822
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:09,072
where Google you provided an identity by example, so you
You have an account on Gmail who serves you to identity for all your

823
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:15,761
stuff at google and for all the tricks of people who pass by
Google and bottom wishes it is fun i have just logged on

824
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:23,246
StackOverflow with my Google address and of course Google
Knows that i am connected on StackOverflow... so Google make ....

825
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:27,961
no problem of course to provide this identity can
It is a way of getting additional information.

826
01:21:28,936 --> 01:21:34,628
For plenty of site this is the easiest way to establish the identity of the person with whom they are.

827
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:37,594
And instead of asking 1 million password and all

828
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:42,205
therefore users it is more comfortable for them

829
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,850
the site it is more simple for them
And google gets things

830
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,707
therefore almost everyone is happy except that there is information which have filtered

831
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:59,908
so if i am logged on to the Stackoverflow rigor it is not too serious. If i had connected on private site of the ...i don't know... party liberal anarchist zoophile

832
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:04,209
down there... i preferred that Google may not be aware,

833
01:22:06,216 --> 01:22:09,044
it is not very small party but they will have for the future

834
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:20,722
therefore persona is a way to respond exactly the same problem but without leak of information

835
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:24,844
i do reentered not on the details of the operation of Persona, there is a bit of cryptography behind,

836
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,332
if you want to we can talk about after

837
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:30,284
but the principle of persona that is always the same thing

838
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:35,351
you have an identity which you am everywhere which is provided by someone anyone

839
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:39,595
but when you connect somewhere the person which you provided the identity has no interesting information

840
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:44,756
The Information is not past that if ... in any case does not filter from this place

841
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,450
therefore it allows me to connect to the site of my favorite party without that Google is the current

842
01:22:50,309 --> 01:22:51,617
problem is that I am the only one

843
01:22:52,504 --> 01:22:54,585
that is not serious we will soon millions

844
01:22:56,447 --> 01:23:00,454
Yes? You want to join?
( ...)

845
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:12,048
it is talked about after separately but
It is a question of cryptography,

846
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:15,219
by and large it transmits the keys
Public and signatures, to

847
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:17,970
summarize it transmits ...

848
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:21,901
The person who provides
The identity provides proof of identity,

849
01:23:21,901 --> 01:23:23,623
but does not know to which he provides

850
01:23:24,192 --> 01:23:27,443
what he knows is that you have logged in somewhere but to no idea of where you are logged in

851
01:23:27,443 --> 01:23:33,908
and that go through the browser and it is the browser which is the only one to have the 2 information simultaneously

852
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:37,940
( ...)

853
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,655
We will look at the details, they will talk about the details after?

854
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:46,013
It can be a bit long as conversation

855
01:23:48,518 --> 01:23:53,710
therefore another project which is now beginning to be adopted by other browsers also

856
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:57,365
it is the Do not track, well microsoft to a little made a mistake in this regard

857
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:00,622
well non-i think that is part of a good intention is

858
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:06,652
thus the principle of Do not track, it mainly come from the principle that people trust in each other.

859
01:24:06,652 --> 01:24:09,121
Which is not necessarily the... finally which is rarely the case

860
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:13,683
but in the case or it is in the face of honest people. This is something useful.

861
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:19,210
The do not track that is just a small information which is sent when your browser connects to a web site

862
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:23,184
it said please do not keep information on me

863
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:29,744
Technologically it will not solve anything, it is just a way of saying do not keep information on me

864
01:24:29,883 --> 01:24:34,045
it must be clearly full of other bricks to make sure that the information are not kept

865
01:24:34,045 --> 01:24:36,293
and this are more bricks that are not technological issues

866
01:24:36,468 --> 01:24:42,885
it is more of the people, audits, ... or of people who swear on the honor that they will not keep the information.

867
01:24:42,885 --> 01:24:49,148
But well it is already a way to start on this subject here

868
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:53,199
so now I think that was about all the browsers have since little.

869
01:24:53,596 --> 01:25:01,197
The latest version of internet explorer of the coup the enabled by default as a say that suddenly it loses all meaning.

870
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:08,365
Because the goal is to say this site is permitted, this site where I have not permitted, and internet explorer fact i does not allow any site.

871
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:11,807
And suddenly all the sites that say if it is like that then "yes yes, count on me to keep it..."

872
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,314
This is an effort, I do not know what that will get out of

873
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:21,675
it is one of the directions in which it is interesting to go there

874
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,497
another hint laughter is collusion

875
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:29,379
then how the active collusion already?

876
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:35,579
No this is not that

877
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:51,121
(you know how it is the active the bar at the bottom ?)

878
01:25:56,973 --> 01:25:57,973
Thank You

879
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:06,716
therefore collusion
Collusion when you want to

880
01:26:08,755 --> 01:26:10,636
Ah i do not have a network that's why

881
01:26:10,636 --> 01:26:11,755
OF agreement down as a worse

882
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:20,702
therefore collusion is an extension which is now provides except error on my part as standard with firefox

883
01:26:20,864 --> 01:26:26,098
which lets you know to a large extent that you track

884
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:29,269
that is what I was calling him spy on the spies

885
01:26:29,686 --> 01:26:32,480
when I told you when I get on a web page

886
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:36,582
and that there is a button like, he has information which filter of him to facebook

887
01:26:37,584 --> 01:26:42,406
that you said La Kaze - is that you can detect this filtering of information

888
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:47,041
Collusion is an extension that does this automatically

889
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:55,963
We do not have all the information, but already you can get a good idea of a certain numbers of information Which filter while it is in really doubted not

890
01:26:57,599 --> 01:27:01,779
so typical of that you go to a site, with a button like

891
01:27:01,779 --> 01:27:03,308
you are going to have filtered information

892
01:27:03,308 --> 01:27:08,891
Therefore y has a mesh, which is displayed, therefore your site just to connect to facebook

893
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,305
forgiveness?

894
01:27:11,735 --> 01:27:13,770
Yes that's it, a directed graph

895
01:27:15,636 --> 01:27:21,773
When you connect to a site with a button or +1 which uses
Google develop

896
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:25,231
console?

897
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:32,627
A trick that allows you to have the statistics of connection, to find out what time the people are connected, or it is connected, ...

898
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:36,021
therefore a very practical tool, I used it in as a webmaster

899
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:39,613
Of course you need to know that the information are stored at Google, and go to google

900
01:27:40,987 --> 01:27:42,503
Google found a way to serve as

901
01:27:42,695 --> 01:27:46,449
they did it because it is convenient, but it is very convenient for them also

902
01:27:46,643 --> 01:27:49,701
therefore collusion detects all these kinds of information

903
01:27:49,989 --> 01:27:55,823
they are not telling you exactly what kind of information that passes but you said that there is a leak of information in this direction

904
01:27:56,182 --> 01:28:03,199
and that we develop in a way that people having a bit of Technical, i do not think that Mr. Everyone will happen to use it

905
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:19,511
but you to priori, you must be able to use it and make wow why the web site of the party mentioned previously given information to i do not know the DGSE with a button like DGSE

906
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,377
has less to be wacko

907
01:28:26,163 --> 01:28:31,390
i do you not speak to the market place of firefox os because you have a special guest for it

908
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,635
No no i'll let
(I have nothing on the market place)

909
01:28:40,994 --> 01:28:42,676
I'll mention briefly Tor

910
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:47,533
then the hint I mentioned to you previously that is the mozilla, Tor that is absolutely not the mozilla

911
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:48,903
we like but this is not we

912
01:28:49,285 --> 01:28:52,935
Mozilla is, finally we sum 1 players in this battle

913
01:28:52,935 --> 01:28:54,352
There are plenty of people who have been fighting

914
01:28:54,352 --> 01:28:58,609
it turns out, you are a more visible, ya cool for us, but there are lots of other people who do things

915
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:09,065
therefore Tor, it is a protocol and tools to enable to connect while maintaining his anonymity

916
01:29:11,156 --> 01:29:15,557
including in the dictatorships, it is planned in particular to connect in the dictatorships

917
01:29:17,076 --> 01:29:21,785
of other things, there is Extensions for firefox that are not made by mozilla for the coup

918
01:29:22,363 --> 01:29:27,388
BetterPrivacy, Ghostery which will detect any other type of leakage of information

919
01:29:27,388 --> 01:29:30,392
and cut to the source therefore personally i ..

920
01:29:30,392 --> 01:29:32,296
Ghostery cut the leaks to the source

921
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:35,466
BetterPrivacy cleans the super cookies

922
01:29:35,841 --> 01:29:41,011
I do not know if you know, there is the principle of cookies, super cookies, cookies zombie, all ...

923
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:42,008
Anyway...

924
01:29:42,008 --> 01:29:48,523
BetterPrivacy tried to ensure that the tricks that are trying very, very strongly to dig among you have less of a chance to do

925
01:29:51,315 --> 01:29:53,295
that is the front number 1 for the fight against the privacy

926
01:29:54,273 --> 01:29:56,354
the front number 2

927
01:29:56,961 --> 01:29:59,416
We want the web belongs to its users.

928
01:29:59,474 --> 01:30:02,175
Bottom it means that the users to do the web

929
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:07,880
all the world cannot be it person but it is going to make sure that there will be someone that he is already

930
01:30:08,787 --> 01:30:10,330
down our activities at mozilla education are part of that

931
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,810
we will already talk about the IT professionals mostly,

932
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:20,710
but we tried to explain to them what i you have tried to explain everything to the hour

933
01:30:21,696 --> 01:30:26,088
there is also an attempt to work with you on projects, student projects, internships and all...

934
01:30:26,564 --> 01:30:27,622
Web maker

935
01:30:28,492 --> 01:30:32,556
Web maker that is the counterpart of the education but for people who are not computer professionals

936
01:30:32,556 --> 01:30:36,665
but try to teach them to manufacture when even a part of the web

937
01:30:37,233 --> 01:30:38,896
therefore their Learn how to make a web page

938
01:30:38,995 --> 01:30:44,647
will not be what their learn to ... there are plenty of other tricks of the kind

939
01:30:44,727 --> 01:30:48,194
Their learn ... what he call "webmeter"

940
01:30:48,308 --> 01:30:52,018
their learn to understand how the web works and do not be of mere consumer of the web

941
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:56,516
including there is a tool within the framework of mozilla

942
01:30:56,649 --> 01:31:00,035
Mozilla webmaker Drawing which is a web editor any beast online

943
01:31:00,236 --> 01:31:03,979
IT is a web page that allows you to edit web pages with a rendering immediate

944
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,052
This is very convenient to learn to do all kinds of things

945
01:31:08,393 --> 01:31:15,739
Ah there is another hint which is the web inspector

946
01:31:19,294 --> 01:31:24,315
because when even a web page is a nice web page that when It is 3D view

947
01:31:27,759 --> 01:31:31,961
I can zoom
You want i zoom?

948
01:31:37,411 --> 01:31:38,166
The goal

949
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:40,881
there is not that the 3D mode is being played on ya minecraft

950
01:31:42,536 --> 01:31:46,693
More generally, the inspector is to try understand how does a web page

951
01:31:46,693 --> 01:31:48,823
that is-what he has done that particular tick is what he has done kicking out

952
01:31:48,823 --> 01:31:51,264
of way either to the correct if this is your web page

953
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:53,356
is to take the things if this is not your web page

954
01:31:55,143 --> 01:32:00,961
it was Popcorn, which is a result in line to edit and put in place of the video

955
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:04,058
of new it is to learn how to make stuff

956
01:32:04,175 --> 01:32:07,676
not necessarily for it professionals but it can be very convenient

957
01:32:07,676 --> 01:32:13,831
and then it was firefox OS here also that torn too, I will always let my colleague in spoke of that I have finished

958
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,301
after there are the tools to fabricate things

959
01:32:19,837 --> 01:32:23,847
I sense that the people will no longer remain attentive very long to assume that they are even it is not serious

960
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,952
Ah no, it is because you love the bike! Yes this is a bike firefox see

961
01:32:32,685 --> 01:32:35,025
It innovates in mozilla

962
01:32:36,033 --> 01:32:46,763
Therefore, we have plenty of tools designed to help people develop, mostly in the framework of a web page, but not only

963
01:32:46,763 --> 01:32:50,061
so there is all of our development tools, the inspector in fact party

964
01:32:50,783 --> 01:32:53,813
it was a javascript editor online

965
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:58,694
it has the tools to help you determine what is the javascript and why it bug

966
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:01,101
not only the debugger

967
01:33:01,735 --> 01:33:03,950
Of The tools to try to make the references here above

968
01:33:04,431 --> 01:33:07,860
the tools that enables you to determine why is it that web pages is slowl and all

969
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,589
that is a front, the front development tool

970
01:33:13,295 --> 01:33:16,127
Say a sub front
Another under front

971
01:33:16,127 --> 01:33:18,825
This is the web applications open

972
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:29,773
from our days we have reached a new level of functionality on the web or we really can do plenty of things

973
01:33:30,622 --> 01:33:33,586
a good example, and I will again quote google so there is this time

974
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,811
they arrive to make google docs

975
01:33:36,055 --> 01:33:38,985
and google docs is pretty darn impressive when even

976
01:33:38,985 --> 01:33:41,896
it is not so long ago that that would definitely not possible

977
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:45,480
so there are plenty of other things that can be done with the web now,

978
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,823
we can make calls with the web, you'll probably be a demonstration earlier

979
01:33:50,267 --> 01:33:52,344
you can do the videos conferences with the web

980
01:33:53,888 --> 01:34:01,045
You can do games with the web, 3D games therefore Here is the 3D view but it is purely done with web technologies

981
01:34:04,045 --> 01:34:11,256
therefore the photo that I have given you everything to the time it is cube i think or i know more

982
01:34:11,256 --> 01:34:14,366
but a style of the game Quake, which is running entirely on the web

983
01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:17,735
i am frag completely

984
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:22,489
There is plenty of thing that we can to make our days with the web

985
01:34:23,123 --> 01:34:27,866
we have a goal
Release all these applications

986
01:34:28,787 --> 01:34:44,181
that we can write almost any applications, we will not certainly have 100% of the applications, but 95% of the applications that are written with the web, by the web, the web and with the open formats and with the spirit of open web in mind.

987
01:34:44,199 --> 01:34:47,988
It is quite ambitious, down it will be really changed the world

988
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:50,271
we will have applications that will work on all platforms

989
01:34:50,354 --> 01:34:55,584
with the spirit open web will be the data which you belong, that is the most difficult part i think

990
01:34:56,936 --> 01:35:05,256
and the job, but there is work above, it is working with the W3C, with our competitors, we are working even with facebook it is to say,

991
01:35:05,718 --> 01:35:13,902
and there are plenty of job but it is something which advance and who advance well, and you are going to have a demo to the hour of ... to what point it advance

992
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:22,279
There is as well that things do not depend on absolutely no mozilla, kind JQuery, NodeJS, ...

993
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:30,955
full of other tools that Once again contribute to make the innovation, the development in the hands of users

994
01:35:31,065 --> 01:35:37,907
once again what is the difference between NodeJS and VisualStudio C++, we are going to say C++ Visualstudio

995
01:35:39,469 --> 01:35:42,349
You will need nothing to begin with NodeJS, you need a computer

996
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:50,909
You do not need an authorization of which that this itself, you do not need a blue card, you just need a computer. Then he can be taken a blue card for a computer.

997
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:55,773
We are not going to solve all the problems

998
01:35:55,865 --> 01:36:02,356
but once again all of this, this kind of things and to make the innovation to the hands of the whole world, we count on you to participate in a full of way.

999
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:04,907
Well I have a transparent on this issue

1000
01:36:05,919 --> 01:36:08,123
so there are plenty of ways to participate and there are a lot on you

1001
01:36:08,645 --> 01:36:14,390
not but seriously when I say we count on you, uh ... I'd like you to help us !

1002
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:18,404
There is full of how to help, you can go there with the code

1003
01:36:18,910 --> 01:36:21,376
Therefore you to priori you can help with the code

1004
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:22,623
there is not that with the code

1005
01:36:22,936 --> 01:36:26,655
we still have a need for people to help on issues of translation

1006
01:36:27,169 --> 01:36:30,439
Firefox is available in 90 languages something like that?

1007
01:36:30,993 --> 01:36:36,925
Including in languages type breton, including the Horseshoe

1008
01:36:37,231 --> 01:36:41,265
Finally full of language, which have been added recently?

1009
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,674
Therefore the languages far from me

1010
01:36:47,204 --> 01:36:48,638
and we almost had a version in Clubon

1011
01:36:49,078 --> 01:36:50,351
HAS the has not been in final?

1012
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,164
We had of the voluntary and everything and it was more that of the libraries

1013
01:36:57,154 --> 01:36:59,042
We are counting on you to the version clubon

1014
01:37:04,531 --> 01:37:06,437
another thing which is very important

1015
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:13,251
that is all the issues of innovation does not stop has firefox, will not stop at mozilla tools

1016
01:37:13,432 --> 01:37:21,902
we need, and when I say we it is the free world, the web free to need people to develop applications in this spirit.

1017
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,885
To develop applications using the technology and the web free, the web is open

1018
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,853
and with the state of mind of the web is open, or the information belong to their user

1019
01:37:33,016 --> 01:37:34,614
is something very important.

1020
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,110
I think that is the point on which you can the more we help

1021
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,365
and it won't be a priori not in class

1022
01:37:39,752 --> 01:37:43,126
but we want to ... go get chic participate

1023
01:37:44,824 --> 01:37:46,190
well what else?

1024
01:37:46,424 --> 01:37:54,078
Of course you can use the technologies, down more than there is for people who use open technologies, less people there are who use the technologies locked and owner.

1025
01:37:54,824 --> 01:37:55,717
Therefore it is much

1026
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,013
more there is for people who are talking around them and font ...

1027
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:05,286
And therefore say Facebook you spied a little, you know firefox OS is udderly better than all the rest.

1028
01:38:05,976 --> 01:38:08,045
How come you have not yet tested, but I do not want to know

1029
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:10,365
more so there are some people who are like this.

1030
01:38:10,727 --> 01:38:12,526
More to advance the cause.

1031
01:38:13,984 --> 01:38:19,205
And finally, it has been a big hint that if call bugzilla, which contains 800,000 bugs

1032
01:38:20,985 --> 01:38:22,251
a good portion of them are closed

1033
01:38:22,251 --> 01:38:23,496
Not all

1034
01:38:25,193 --> 01:38:35,103
therefore we rely on you to bring us your bugs, if you use a hint with our technologies tell us when there is something that does not, notify us if y has some things to improve or leave us a nice word if you adore.

1035
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:36,031
It is always good for the morale

1036
01:38:40,098 --> 01:38:50,960
down I thank you for listening to me, it was long and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate except if it is the issues of cryptography, are managed separately.

1037
01:38:54,415 --> 01:38:56,719
When you talk about Google, how they earn money ....

1038
01:39:05,392 --> 01:39:12,260
It is precisely when you give the example of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, they have all almost the same economic system.

1039
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:14,668
Therefore it is-to-say i retrieved your information, i the sells later

1040
01:39:14,668 --> 01:39:18,022
and I do not know how microsoft earns his money but I am not particularly interested.

1041
01:39:18,022 --> 01:39:23,598
But I just want to have an idea of how Mozilla for example does to earn his money.

1042
01:39:23,598 --> 01:39:25,105
It is a very good question,

1043
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:30,063
it is a very good question

1044
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:33,339
then I will tell you it was some donations.

1045
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:34,953
But it does not cover a lot of thing.

1046
01:39:36,049 --> 01:39:39,434
The hint that we cover the most, this is that

1047
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:42,554
we rented a few pixels at the top right of the screen.

1048
01:39:42,759 --> 01:39:44,525
And it pays a lot of money.

1049
01:39:48,202 --> 01:39:57,662
Not the contract must be renewed at a time every 3 years. There has been a negotiation to be renewed and it has been renewed

1050
01:39:57,827 --> 01:39:59,128
and you have an amount?

1051
01:39:59,128 --> 01:40:01,318
Uh that i have absolutely no right to tell you

1052
01:40:03,815 --> 01:40:09,376
then i can just quote a statement which has been public for a certain Tristan NITOT

1053
01:40:09,376 --> 01:40:11,496
I do not have the right to tell you there is content

1054
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:18,434
If you earn more money that is necessarily that there will be more money

1055
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:21,808
if you win more money google they would have had the money to other

1056
01:40:21,808 --> 01:40:27,269
Yes you need to know that there is another person who font of search engines and who'd like take the place of google in the number of users,

1057
01:40:27,269 --> 01:40:34,556
so it was $450 million of user, there are a number of business who are willing to pay money to have some pixel before 450 million

1058
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:46,934
there is actually a Version of mozilla which puts Bing first

1059
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:52,092
Therefore uh that is
It is the engine of firefox OS 3

1060
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,218
At the same time there are plenty of search engine in the world.

1061
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:05,490
It is clear in France and a good part in the world, he has a contract with Google that puts google in the first position.

1062
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:09,215
In Russia until recently it was a Russian search engine which was in first position.

1063
01:41:09,215 --> 01:41:11,202
In Japan until recently it was Yahoo!

1064
01:41:11,952 --> 01:41:13,080
Finally voila...

1065
01:41:13,086 --> 01:41:16,656
It is not obliged to have ... it is not married with Google not more.

1066
01:41:17,278 --> 01:41:19,704
And if I say well of Google of time that is is not only

1067
01:41:19,704 --> 01:41:21,117
good morning, Mr. Google excuse we

1068
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:24,574
therefore this is not exclusively because it has agreements with Google

1069
01:41:25,243 --> 01:41:26,171
IT is independent

1070
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:34,486
forgiveness? That Google Chrome has created?

1071
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,577
well it bothers us a little, it depends on the days

1072
01:41:37,577 --> 01:41:41,072
because we have to admit that they have done very good work on plenty of things.

1073
01:41:41,072 --> 01:41:43,722
They have really pushed the things in a right direction

1074
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:45,701
therefore we are there including to keep them honest,

1075
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:48,868
to verify that they saw in stuff a little too embarrassing

1076
01:41:49,924 --> 01:41:57,814
to keep... to remind people that yes when you type something in the search bar... that Google is aware, stuff like that.

1077
01:41:57,814 --> 01:42:04,029
Therefore we want to ask for alternatives continuously always to offer alternatives that is the most favorable to the user.

1078
01:42:04,036 --> 01:42:06,283
This is when even our reason to be.

1079
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:10,166
Therefore Chrome it depends on the days, there are days where they bother us

1080
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:16,633
they bother us when it is provided automatically when all the people who installed the new version of flash, there is chromium which is automatically installed as the default browser

1081
01:42:16,633 --> 01:42:17,625
it bothers us

1082
01:42:18,126 --> 01:42:21,415
but overall I would say that the effect has been positive on the web

1083
01:42:21,837 --> 01:42:26,613
in fact, at mozilla it is not intended to be hegemonic on the web

1084
01:42:26,613 --> 01:42:28,632
It is in fact sheet to have 80% of market share

1085
01:42:28,946 --> 01:42:31,192
is very content with 20% or even 15% of

1086
01:42:31,219 --> 01:42:36,195
what you just want to do is to have a share of the market sufficient to that you might not be ignored

1087
01:42:36,304 --> 01:42:43,221
we works with web standards, only the web standards Therefore everything that is readable by us is readable by other.

1088
01:42:43,221 --> 01:42:49,001
Therefore that is what they tried to force the web to stay in a state interoperable/open,

1089
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:59,465
so is a i know how much 50
Overall Chrome is 25-30 also

1090
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:01,153
(a priori there is 1 in France )
Internet Explorer and such

1091
01:43:01,701 --> 01:43:04,799
so there is a situation which is not far from what I would characterize as the ideal

1092
01:43:04,977 --> 01:43:12,935
or it is past to there is 10years IE6 to 98% of market share to overall 30-35%

1093
01:43:13,074 --> 01:43:19,113
and Chrome and firefox which are almost equally such 30-35

1094
01:43:19,209 --> 01:43:32,258
Therefore there is no editor of browser that can do something without the web standards

1095
01:43:32,258 --> 01:43:38,229
even microsoft its IE9 which is very correct, I don't have much to blame microsoft on IE9

1096
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:44,856
I am quite content that they have finally accepted the fact that they were not the standard of the web

1097
01:43:45,035 --> 01:43:48,556
that the web was around a lot of other things and that it was necessary that they The following

1098
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:53,274
Therefore it is not bad, there are also projects on which you have a partnership with Google

1099
01:43:54,116 --> 01:43:56,263
of tricks which have more or less well market, I think it is a crashing

1100
01:43:56,441 --> 01:44:01,419
but the currently webrtc which is likely skykiller

1101
01:44:01,419 --> 01:44:05,342
Grosso modo we will get to the skype in a browser without skype

1102
01:44:05,437 --> 01:44:11,199
so we launched with Google, Google has placed it in his version there is i know more than 1 months and a half or 2

1103
01:44:15,645 --> 01:44:18,016
brief it is the things that you cannot move any single

1104
01:44:18,075 --> 01:44:21,724
in a general way for that one standard is validated by the W3C

1105
01:44:21,724 --> 01:44:23,104
must be 2 independent implementations

1106
01:44:23,246 --> 01:44:29,401
so if Google and the fact that Mozilla the fact, it was 2 implementations Independent, it becomes a standard.

1107
01:44:29,497 --> 01:44:32,209
If there is any single to do so, we cannot fight

1108
01:44:32,292 --> 01:44:40,241
that the household at 3 overall, there are times we as a developer it is a little upset to see that our colleagues at Google are doing less well.

1109
01:44:40,394 --> 01:44:43,575
There are other times it made peter the news because it is better than them.

1110
01:44:43,716 --> 01:44:49,720
And it is a competition which is healthy, it is argued, i found... it ... I am quite content bothered

1111
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:55,387
It is true that there are certainly of links, there is a regular people come and tell us haha i am go home ... that i used Chrome now

1112
01:44:55,387 --> 01:44:56,775
Ok, finally...

1113
01:44:56,895 --> 01:44:59,856
So-called we just why so that we can improve firefox

1114
01:45:01,362 --> 01:45:08,369
we will get back
Does that answer your question?

1115
01:45:10,023 --> 01:45:13,779
It is there any other questions?
Yes?

1116
01:45:15,348 --> 01:45:18,469
If someone wants to filer the micro, it is diametrically the opposite.

1117
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:45,875
In fact it was to get back on what you have said

1118
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:46,302
yes?

1119
01:45:46,447 --> 01:45:53,345
Finally I ask you with the mounted of Chrome in the market shares of,

1120
01:45:53,345 --> 01:46:13,221
is-what, how to say, the Mozilla foundation is not brought to disappear in the long run because if a large part of your resource comes from the small logo... and therefore how you are going to do after to meet your need...

1121
01:46:13,221 --> 01:46:18,875
For the moment we sum frankly content of the situation, for several reasons

1122
01:46:18,875 --> 01:46:21,022
that you are referring only to the economic issue, there is agreement?

1123
01:46:21,595 --> 01:46:24,765
We have never had so much to user that currently

1124
01:46:25,014 --> 01:46:29,191
we have 1.5 billion users, just a little less than 1.5 billion users

1125
01:46:29,562 --> 01:46:31,747
what is when not even poorly,

1126
01:46:32,024 --> 01:46:36,577
thus, the situation is good for us, as long as we have users

1127
01:46:36,577 --> 01:46:41,731
and for the moment it rise, if ever a day if our market share was like this

1128
01:46:42,402 --> 01:46:45,590
Actually it would arise questions on our survival

1129
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:51,773
at the same time it is the question on our survival whatever our means of financing if our market share was like this

1130
01:46:52,176 --> 01:46:54,177
therefore from this point of view, it is going

1131
01:46:54,264 --> 01:46:58,153
there is one thing which could possibly ... finally there are several things that could possibly threaten us

1132
01:46:58,379 --> 01:47:07,302
if it There was only one search engine, actually they would not necessarily interest to rent a little bit of space at home

1133
01:47:07,302 --> 01:47:12,159
but for the moment there are two major companies who made the search engines and they like to put the sticks in the wheels one of the other

1134
01:47:12,305 --> 01:47:14,647
from this point of view it's very nice for us

1135
01:47:14,866 --> 01:47:16,650
there are some other smaller also

1136
01:47:16,857 --> 01:47:21,699
there are other companies as well who would like well or likes to have the small pixels at the top right

1137
01:47:21,837 --> 01:47:25,405
Uh i thoughtful if y has of things confidential

1138
01:47:25,405 --> 01:47:36,004
well there is to other businesses who , full of people who would be willing to make the agreements with us on this The point of view, even if Google decided for one reason or another to stop the agreement with us

1139
01:47:36,138 --> 01:47:38,107
it was not bad a backup plan

1140
01:47:38,574 --> 01:47:47,622
finally precisely by backup plan, if I understand the fact of the matter is this is that a large part of your resources comes from Google

1141
01:47:47,799 --> 01:47:49,776
Yes this is not secret

1142
01:47:51,435 --> 01:48:00,334
and is what it would not be more sensible for the foundation to think about a Business Plan for his...

1143
01:48:00,334 --> 01:48:04,861
There are thoughtful, I have absolutely no right to say

1144
01:48:05,366 --> 01:48:09,470
there is very little that is confidential in Mozilla, but ac, ac in fact part

1145
01:48:17,773 --> 01:48:19,263
is there of other questions?

1146
01:48:20,621 --> 01:48:23,277
Otherwise I can leave the floor to my colleague

1147
01:48:24,652 --> 01:48:30,145
he wants to talk about also, he is bored for a while, I heard him snoring since here

1148
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:35,274
therefore questions or not questions?

1149
01:48:37,758 --> 01:48:44,535
Therefore I think that there is no question then otherwise you would come see me after and there will be talk of crypto

1150
01:49:46,025 --> 01:49:49,617
well, i will try to not too you are bothering too long

1151
01:49:49,642 --> 01:49:51,642
but, uh

1152
01:49:52,773 --> 01:49:55,362
We will you talk about actually of Firefox OS

1153
01:49:56,922 --> 01:49:59,642
so i am call Fabien Cazenave aka Kaze -

1154
01:49:59,642 --> 01:50:03,501
I am contributor mozilla since 6years now

1155
01:50:04,069 --> 01:50:08,062
and employee, finally i work ... paid by mozilla since about 1 year

1156
01:50:08,522 --> 01:50:10,426
and...

1157
01:50:10,597 --> 01:50:13,329
mainly for working on this project here

1158
01:50:15,499 --> 01:50:17,841
so as you David has said all the time on

1159
01:50:17,841 --> 01:50:20,790
the situation at the moment that it was on the mobile

1160
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:25,275
that is about it
There is a choice between Apple IOS

1161
01:50:25,275 --> 01:50:29,881
therefore it past mandatory by the appstore, it is how they call it

1162
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:34,822
on only a terminal apple
There is a choice between google/Android

1163
01:50:34,822 --> 01:50:40,807
so we past GooglePlay for applications,

1164
01:50:40,906 --> 01:50:43,842
it was against the choice of the terminal which is pretty cool

1165
01:50:44,091 --> 01:50:48,481
and a 3th, I do not know if someone has a windows phone, therefore ya...

1166
01:50:48,481 --> 01:50:49,334
How Many android?

1167
01:50:51,005 --> 01:50:52,544
How many of the iPhone?

1168
01:50:52,943 --> 01:50:54,666
... Bottom we do congratulate you not

1169
01:50:58,103 --> 01:51:00,922
and who has anything other than a...

1170
01:51:07,603 --> 01:51:13,514
those who are other is the phone has a web browser?

1171
01:51:13,539 --> 01:51:15,539
Yes

1172
01:51:16,563 --> 01:51:18,241
No, what is your os ?

1173
01:51:21,532 --> 01:51:25,030
Blackberry
This is what operating system?

1174
01:51:26,255 --> 01:51:28,569
Ah but it is about the same thing than it

1175
01:51:29,241 --> 01:51:30,835
me i speak something other than one of the 3

1176
01:51:31,209 --> 01:51:32,564
</a>

1177
01:51:32,965 --> 01:51:34,483
Ah the WebOS class

1178
01:51:35,368 --> 01:51:35,921
Maemo

1179
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:36,769
Class

1180
01:51:38,762 --> 01:51:39,564
pretty

1181
01:51:44,863 --> 01:51:45,452
well Non-non-

1182
01:51:48,817 --> 01:51:52,015
being is in the species and Maemo is good

1183
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,348
therefore as David explained to you all at the time

1184
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,720
it is not satisfied with the situation there,

1185
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:05,479
because the battle, I think that they can be considered as it is earned on the desktop browser, it was 10 years ago

1186
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:07,813
it is reproduced today on the mobile

1187
01:52:07,813 --> 01:52:12,119
Related grosso modo webkit which is become him also the IE6 for now

1188
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:15,865
it was only 1 rendering engine for all the platforms or mobile almost

1189
01:52:16,003 --> 01:52:18,491
because windows mobile up to evidence to the contrary does not exist

1190
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:26,608
and we Has of the coup in addition to this technical limitation, it was in addition to the limitations we are going to say

1191
01:52:26,778 --> 01:52:31,569
or the legal applications are only accessible as in showing white tab

1192
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:34,544
by putting his blue card number of the beginning as a that has to do

1193
01:52:34,712 --> 01:52:38,698
Via the foundries of applications such as: AppleStore, GooglePlay, ...

1194
01:52:39,858 --> 01:52:43,811
So voila, I am sorry the slides are in English

1195
01:52:43,811 --> 01:52:46,492
because I did it a little late and I retrieve the press material Mozilla

1196
01:52:46,831 --> 01:52:48,464
therefore limited revenue choices

1197
01:52:49,306 --> 01:52:53,519
if i am mobile application developer and I want to sell it on iphone

1198
01:52:53,519 --> 01:52:57,151
i don't have a choice, I have to go through the store AppleStore

1199
01:52:57,249 --> 01:53:03,951
Vogue they have an online edition to the applestore, it's call The Iranian edition

1200
01:53:04,174 --> 01:53:07,611
because to cross all the criteria of acceptance AppleStore

1201
01:53:08,077 --> 01:53:12,279
they are forced to make compromises which are sometimes surprising of the contained that they want to sell

1202
01:53:12,279 --> 01:53:16,758
it is a fashion magazine, but not y has a packet of stuff which does not pass to the applestore

1203
01:53:17,996 --> 01:53:23,265
Therefore, it wants to put a little bit of freedom in this all

1204
01:53:23,595 --> 01:53:29,658
we want that the developers can develop, without to this worry about these technical features or commercial

1205
01:53:30,212 --> 01:53:36,721
it wants that the developers can propose their work directly to users

1206
01:53:37,516 --> 01:53:40,105
by passing or not by a store, it would not matter to us

1207
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:44,682
and

1208
01:53:45,628 --> 01:53:52,577
this is a project which aims to release the developers that the users for these usages that

1209
01:53:52,985 --> 01:53:57,088
currently the users are a Little in their honeymoon with all these services here

1210
01:53:57,328 --> 01:54:03,720
so long as they do not reset their account Apple remote as it happened to a journalist for Wired the last month or before.

1211
01:54:04,058 --> 01:54:07,192
As long as nothing too awful their arrive

1212
01:54:08,554 --> 01:54:12,696
they are for the without just the comfort that their brings these interfaces

1213
01:54:13,025 --> 01:54:17,552
Therefore Android, but our role is to make it as good as the user, the freedom in more

1214
01:54:17,769 --> 01:54:21,160
and of course we want to do better for the udderly developers

1215
01:54:23,099 --> 01:54:24,297
Therefore that the idea

1216
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:27,384
Firefox OS, it was called Boot2Gecko at the outset

1217
01:54:28,378 --> 01:54:31,832
it is part of an idea a little, kind end of evening

1218
01:54:33,074 --> 01:54:37,416
and if we start directly the device

1219
01:54:37,714 --> 01:54:44,704
not on a BSD Kernel IOS therefore
Or a linux kernel type android or etc

1220
01:54:44,856 --> 01:54:48,496
but directly on Gecko
That is the firefox rendering engine

1221
01:54:49,074 --> 01:54:55,896
and y'in has full who have said, ya i can try it 10 years with the machines at the time and so on etc

1222
01:54:56,082 --> 01:54:57,264
brief it was apparent the old stories of war

1223
01:54:57,569 --> 01:55:00,072
it was said in fact, there is no reason

1224
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:03,136
it could very well do that
Have a system

1225
01:55:04,242 --> 01:55:09,960
a kernel ultra minimalist, to start directly on the Gecko rendering engine

1226
01:55:10,386 --> 01:55:12,903
In fact, it is a way

1227
01:55:13,913 --> 01:55:17,872
it is as if it was transformed into a browser as an operating system to simplify

1228
01:55:19,234 --> 01:55:22,665
And then Therefore firefox os this is a project that came like that

1229
01:55:22,978 --> 01:55:27,825
It was said that if we will only use is that it knows how to do in Firefox

1230
01:55:27,926 --> 01:55:32,104
that is to say the HTML5 and use of open standards of the web

1231
01:55:33,598 --> 01:55:41,029
and that we will see up or it can go and is it that is able to do a system..

1232
01:55:41,231 --> 01:55:44,774
Finally a operating system for mobile just complete with web standards

1233
01:55:44,781 --> 01:55:45,553
ya?

1234
01:55:46,102 --> 01:55:51,905
Does this change something the fact to start on Gecko? It is faster?

1235
01:55:52,475 --> 01:55:56,249
Yes, in fact, that the first prototype they used was the samsung s2 galaxy

1236
01:55:56,939 --> 01:55:58,888
Very beautiful machine, beautiful screen and everything,

1237
01:55:59,033 --> 01:56:00,257
finally I am a big fan

1238
01:56:03,283 --> 01:56:06,449
One of the functions that it has put very long to have, it is the reload

1239
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:10,361
the F5 you know when you made the web development, the F5 to refresh the page of the web browser

1240
01:56:11,019 --> 01:56:16,520
Grosso modo there started a galaxy s2 on android, it is of the order of 30sec to 60 sec

1241
01:56:17,674 --> 01:56:21,760
and in fact, as we did not know refresh a page on the device (device),

1242
01:56:21,986 --> 01:56:23,241
it is a little bit painful when we bump above

1243
01:56:24,795 --> 01:56:25,913
we found a way to the plant

1244
01:56:26,891 --> 01:56:29,433
like this when we plant Gecko, it restarts fully the rest.

1245
01:56:30,315 --> 01:56:35,264
And the whole loop, that is-to-say it presses on the button it returns the command that will crash Gecko

1246
01:56:35,546 --> 01:56:37,633
and it restarts and it was done in less than 1/2 second

1247
01:56:40,099 --> 01:56:45,057
So in fact the idea that is clear, for the year 0 of firefox OS

1248
01:56:45,282 --> 01:56:48,961
is not the galaxy s2, it is cheating, it is too fast

1249
01:56:49,105 --> 01:56:50,536
no interest to us.

1250
01:56:51,266 --> 01:56:56,544
Goal is truly the phones to very, very cheap price

1251
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:58,272
and it will be said these phones here

1252
01:56:58,490 --> 01:57:01,169
which for the moment do nothing to do other than phone, alarm

1253
01:57:01,403 --> 01:57:03,081
mine fact flashlight I like it a lot

1254
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:06,688
and we would like it to do also web browser

1255
01:57:06,986 --> 01:57:10,865
and that we are able to install a package of application above, also because it will be lighter

1256
01:57:11,114 --> 01:57:14,521
it will be able to install firefox OS on any phone?

1257
01:57:18,283 --> 01:57:19,393
We support in some

1258
01:57:22,355 --> 01:57:24,969
therefore it was: Samsung galaxy s2, the nexus S,

1259
01:57:32,214 --> 01:57:35,092
you said galaxy s2 but you cannot count it as a former

1260
01:57:36,189 --> 01:57:38,949
This is not old?
Galaxy s3 then I do not know.

1261
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:45,382
But overall no, it not intended to device like that.

1262
01:57:45,576 --> 01:57:46,510
I'll explain why in fact

1263
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:52,423
Yes y'in has

1264
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:02,999
the priority of mozilla is not to do on a powerful device, but are people in the community that evolved on that

1265
01:58:03,321 --> 01:58:10,358
that is not as in the community IMO, or is there of real wackos who run it on the M900 or stuff like that, I have a 900 at home and I like a lot

1266
01:58:11,146 --> 01:58:15,358
so voila
And it is not in this kind of ...

1267
01:58:15,758 --> 01:58:19,149
the kooks who did it, we hired a packet to that they work for us now.

1268
01:58:19,487 --> 01:58:22,885
And so they can do that on phones that will really sell

1269
01:58:23,671 --> 01:58:26,685
Finally this is not we who will sell them but it is hoped that they are going to be able to sell full

1270
01:58:27,526 --> 01:58:30,165
because it is as for the history desktop browser

1271
01:58:30,326 --> 01:58:35,910
The browser on the desktop, all of this have a focus, because if it was a packet of user,

1272
01:58:36,376 --> 01:58:39,037
to deflect the trend it must be full of user

1273
01:58:39,287 --> 01:58:41,405
not that for laughs and do things in big place,

1274
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:48,221
so in the tricks friendly of the fact of having a mobile OS completely web

1275
01:58:48,462 --> 01:58:52,965
is that it allows you to be creative at the level of the interface

1276
01:58:54,304 --> 01:58:59,997
then I think it is pretty clear that it is not designers born among we the dev, in mozilla

1277
01:59:00,207 --> 01:59:02,589
but we can do the Udderly different tricks

1278
01:59:04,599 --> 01:59:06,586
these styles here in CSS, so it is cool

1279
01:59:06,745 --> 01:59:12,217
You can do the applications, and the skiner completely differently in CSS

1280
01:59:12,435 --> 01:59:17,322
Therefore this, it may be of interest to communities of developer typically for mobile

1281
01:59:17,441 --> 01:59:23,290
because with a relatively low risk of breaking the application, we redefine completely its ergonomics

1282
01:59:23,409 --> 01:59:26,289
This is not just its look &amp; feel, it is downright its way to interact

1283
01:59:26,383 --> 01:59:28,913
is based on the size of the screen, full of things,

1284
01:59:29,675 --> 01:59:37,969
but somewhere we thought that it will also interest and especially manufacturers of phone

1285
01:59:38,078 --> 01:59:42,289
and or operators who will finally be able to make a phone to their image

1286
01:59:42,435 --> 01:59:46,969
instead of having the Android phones which are somewhat similar all A little too much

1287
01:59:47,611 --> 01:59:51,953
they will be able to do their own look &amp; feel

1288
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,073
and this in Mozilla, we love the idea,

1289
01:59:55,972 --> 02:00:00,545
one really liked the idea, unlike that wants to impose a certain homogeneity of style.

1290
02:00:01,043 --> 02:00:03,913
I also understand, that is enough class to have a hint homogeneous

1291
02:00:04,403 --> 02:00:07,770
it wants on the contrary a maximum of freedom development

1292
02:00:08,124 --> 02:00:10,210
(I can add one thing ?)
You can

1293
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:17,658
on this point, I'd like added a thing. We spoke with a number of manufacturer and supplier of telephony

1294
02:00:18,075 --> 02:00:22,945
Overall, there are a number of concern and gimmicks that I hear

1295
02:00:24,474 --> 02:00:29,898
is what is the difference between the phone that they did that and the phone what is the neighbor and the phone that makes it the third

1296
02:00:30,139 --> 02:00:33,802
Therefore the equipment is not exactly the same but from the point of view of the user that is such

1297
02:00:33,913 --> 02:00:35,033
A hand the number of pixels in big

1298
02:00:35,275 --> 02:00:39,285
them they would like inject of things a little different

1299
02:00:40,008 --> 02:00:43,949
because for example it supports a samsung, there is a samsung store in more that no one uses,

1300
02:00:44,303 --> 02:00:47,093
and a samsung note or something like that that person is not used not more than

1301
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:50,406
Ok, it Could not even to realize that this is not the same phone

1302
02:00:51,598 --> 02:01:00,873
so the manufacturers, so this is not the only public of course but we, we need the manufacturers to achieve something

1303
02:01:01,082 --> 02:01:04,025
because, once again, we cannot provide an alternative that if there is credible

1304
02:01:04,153 --> 02:01:07,352
it is credible that if there are users and that if y has not of users there will be no phones for y went with

1305
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:14,665
and the reason for which manufacturers are interested to work on this kind of thing.

1306
02:01:14,858 --> 02:01:18,408
It is that finally they are going to be able to customize their phones

1307
02:01:18,593 --> 02:01:21,964
they will not have to have the appearance Google or Apple

1308
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:24,956
( ...)

1309
02:01:27,127 --> 02:01:29,621
Joker i do not have the right to speak and I do not know who to the right to speak

1310
02:01:32,126 --> 02:01:34,388
I think that there has still not the right to speak about it in fact,

1311
02:01:34,887 --> 02:01:36,645
it is no longer a secret policy

1312
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:42,893
Y'in has a that will be made public shortly shortly and other I cannot speak to

1313
02:01:43,046 --> 02:01:45,005
and others who will arrive

1314
02:01:45,399 --> 02:01:51,393
but globally for the first year they are going to cover the phones to very, very low price what

1315
02:01:51,535 --> 02:01:52,541
less than $50

1316
02:01:57,763 --> 02:02:04,785
(is this that there will be phones, you know the chinese phones that are on Android)

1317
02:02:06,979 --> 02:02:13,689
clearly that these manufacturers of phone Chinese who are of fairly despicable on Android

1318
02:02:14,266 --> 02:02:16,425
which are completely, finally of true slug on android

1319
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,713
because it is of the phones at very cheap prices, which are intended for the emerging country

1320
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:26,991
that is naturally these builders who will be interested in Firefox OS for the first year

1321
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:30,468
Absolutely not, I have never heard of it

1322
02:02:30,493 --> 02:02:39,844
if a user desire the look by default, and not one imposed by the operator that sells the phone or the manufacturer?

1323
02:02:45,505 --> 02:02:49,171
There is a priori not large thing which prevents the user to do what he wants with on this phone

1324
02:02:49,196 --> 02:02:52,071
i cannot well has see how it could be locked, in fact

1325
02:02:52,096 --> 02:02:53,118
it is

1326
02:02:53,119 --> 02:02:58,061
for the moment, it is in a state or it is not facil to lock frankly,

1327
02:02:58,062 --> 02:02:59,245
even we would like

1328
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:04,344
a question is it you like

1329
02:03:04,344 --> 02:03:07,581
in fact, i wants to know a small detail, this is not the look

1330
02:03:07,581 --> 02:03:12,499
but the layer, if there is an operator which produces a layer

1331
02:03:12,499 --> 02:03:16,979
is this that there will be roughly a functionality for eliminated and return to the basic version

1332
02:03:17,004 --> 02:03:19,175
then, if the operator added its layer to him

1333
02:03:19,175 --> 02:03:20,239
is what we can the eliminated or not?

1334
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:20,877
Yes

1335
02:03:20,878 --> 02:03:25,671
everything that we could find on firefox OS, are that of

1336
02:03:25,672 --> 02:03:27,855
Offline web applications, HTML applications5

1337
02:03:28,055 --> 02:03:30,694
We can install and remove relatively easily

1338
02:03:30,694 --> 02:03:33,732
There is an application, that you cannot easily remove

1339
02:03:33,732 --> 02:03:35,185
this is what we call system

1340
02:03:35,262 --> 02:03:39,414
overall, which is what we made the home screen and which launched the other applications

1341
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,702
but ... there is ...

1342
02:03:43,457 --> 02:03:45,553
The operator with whom it deals currently

1343
02:03:45,553 --> 02:03:47,407
so it will be a secret, it is Telefonica

1344
02:03:47,408 --> 02:03:51,226
they tried a long time to have their own application system

1345
02:03:51,227 --> 02:03:55,006
and it was quickly realized that it is the job that he had to leave at Mozilla

1346
02:03:55,007 --> 02:03:58,950
therefore for the present time, there is only 1 application system and it is that of Mozilla

1347
02:04:04,476 --> 02:04:08,030
a student: I wanted to know what type will be the minimalist kernel which you were talking about the beginning?

1348
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:09,820
Linux, what else?

1349
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:14,344
So there it is ...

1350
02:04:15,948 --> 02:04:18,428
If David was an hour of more it you would have talked about the marketplace

1351
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:23,510
but it is typically the idea, is that we want to break the silos.

1352
02:04:23,944 --> 02:04:27,198
We want to replace it by something much more open.

1353
02:04:28,025 --> 02:04:33,655
That any developer can propose to almost any application on almost any marketplace.

1354
02:04:34,039 --> 02:04:39,607
The marketplace in the idea that it is in fact, y'will Mozilla which will be hers but they will be not exclusive of each other.

1355
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:47,159
We share in the idea that the security model will be simpler because we will be running that Web applications.

1356
02:04:47,521 --> 02:04:54,878
When you install an iPhone application, Android, you install the binary code that can type far enough in the bowels of your machine.

1357
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:59,687
On a Web application, roughly, it is in the same conditions of security that on a Web page.

1358
02:05:00,049 --> 02:05:01,303
Even better than on the desktop in fact.

1359
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:05,310
Since it was already the process on the isolated ... all of the different applications on the mobile.

1360
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:15,142
So overall the idea, for the users, in any case for the first year, it is to offer a affordable smartphone.

1361
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:19,279
We can imagine.. finally in the idea that it is in fact, the users of firefoxos ...

1362
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:22,974
The vast majority, this will be their first smartphone.

1363
02:05:23,264 --> 02:05:24,831
Finally me personally, this is my first smartphone.

1364
02:05:26,681 --> 02:05:28,558
And I was pretty happy with my "dom pro" before.

1365
02:05:29,168 --> 02:05:33,510
And it wants to be able to allow a large variety of applications.

1366
02:05:33,808 --> 02:05:40,494
You don't want ... we want to break, in quotes, any possibility of censorship on the applications that can be done to this kind of machine.

1367
02:05:40,872 --> 02:05:44,870
A Web application ... person can prevent anyone from making a Web application.

1368
02:05:45,151 --> 02:05:46,318
Good to knows that.

1369
02:05:47,304 --> 02:05:52,406
We will not only support Web applications but the approach is to support only the Web applications.

1370
02:05:53,289 --> 02:05:56,373
It will be seen at the end of this presentation what does it means.

1371
02:05:56,648 --> 02:06:02,030
So that is the kind of graph that the Americans adorents but that I hated it.

1372
02:06:03,231 --> 02:06:05,830
But overall, it has an axis, that is so that is the ...

1373
02:06:07,151 --> 02:06:11,271
On the horizontal axis, the more it goes to the right and the telephone more he knows to do things classes.

1374
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:14,637
And when we mounted it there, it means that the phone it is expensive.

1375
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:17,694
Therefore currently y'has a kind of ...

1376
02:06:18,728 --> 02:06:21,821
There'a a case of curve like this ...

1377
02:06:22,304 --> 02:06:30,613
Our idea is to propose the same thing as what is currently done in the phones to 150-200 dollars, but for lower prices to 50.

1378
02:06:31,687 --> 02:06:36,141
With ... with just firefox as OS what.

1379
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:43,366
So that is assumed to be the next year, 2013.

1380
02:06:44,809 --> 02:06:49,766
Therefore a small preview of ... then really very far, of the architecture.

1381
02:06:50,135 --> 02:06:55,222
Overall, as I said earlier, it has an architecture that is much more simple.

1382
02:06:55,480 --> 02:07:03,270
Roughly, everything that is in purple, that is really what is simple, which is the standard, which is shared by. ..

1383
02:07:03,785 --> 02:07:08,222
Finally what is defined by the standards already used by lots of people.

1384
02:07:08,488 --> 02:07:14,512
Everything that is blue, that is all that is specific, anything it could hardly be the hands.

1385
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:19,758
Therefore, it is not quoted, but it is globally, that is the case of Android.

1386
02:07:20,153 --> 02:07:34,369
Therefore, it was just a kernel, a ROM in the phone and then after it has a kernel therefore Android Android that is a Linux kernel, it is a virtual machine, i don't know if you have the right to say java but finally it is Dalvik therefore it is ... a JVM what.

1387
02:07:34,806 --> 02:07:38,908
More than a whole bunch of stuff, and it is mainly of native APIS.

1388
02:07:40,013 --> 02:07:41,772
Therefore, if I want to make an application ...

1389
02:07:42,766 --> 02:07:45,004
Currently there the hint that I do not like, I bought a bike.

1390
02:07:45,358 --> 02:07:55,916
I say "wish, I would really like to have a application who follow me, that will make me my geotagging, which trace the hint on Google and which mark the number of elevation positive that I am, the time that I have put etcetera, etcetera ... "

1391
02:07:56,174 --> 02:08:04,516
I discovered there was full of applications that existed for Android, full for the iPhone and this is the code that is very different.

1392
02:08:04,782 --> 02:08:07,605
Because the API Android, the phones are very different, the languages are very different.

1393
02:08:07,951 --> 02:08:14,349
The look &amp; feel is also different, the disparity of the models is that the applications are very different.

1394
02:08:15,999 --> 02:08:18,838
One day, when I would have liked a little bit of time, I would do the same for firefoxos.

1395
02:08:19,278 --> 02:08:22,630
This which will be pretty cool is that it will work on all three terminals of the coup.

1396
02:08:23,247 --> 02:08:26,957
Since, a priori, to almost all devices support the Web technologies.

1397
02:08:27,846 --> 02:08:30,037
The magic is going to happen in this part here.

1398
02:08:30,551 --> 02:08:33,621
That is to say what is called the Device API.

1399
02:08:34,671 --> 02:08:38,133
In Mozilla we call it the Web API because it is placed on the other side but well ...

1400
02:08:38,415 --> 02:08:41,140
But in essence it is an initiative that has started y'has already a time.

1401
02:08:41,405 --> 02:08:45,733
Which is to provide Web API for your browser ...

1402
02:08:46,103 --> 02:08:50,645
it had started with what? Ah yes, y'had a hint which had started, it was the accelerometer.

1403
02:08:50,887 --> 02:08:58,828
We wanted to be able to use its tablet, the do look at and we know how to interpret it in a ... in a Web page.

1404
02:08:59,063 --> 02:09:03,077
Typically, for games, therefore we will begin to expose the API accelerometer.

1405
02:09:03,245 --> 02:09:07,669
I believe that there is an API Joypad also that google has hatched, which is funny.

1406
02:09:08,031 --> 02:09:09,165
Y'a ...

1407
02:09:09,496 --> 02:09:13,605
And then of wire in needle, we know said want in fact it could be the API for just about everything.

1408
02:09:14,647 --> 02:09:19,045
And, what y'a cool when we bump for Mozilla, is that when we made of the APIS like this, APIS.

1409
02:09:19,407 --> 02:09:21,157
We can propose to the standardization.

1410
02:09:21,527 --> 02:09:24,133
We can implement them in first and propose to the standardization.

1411
02:09:24,462 --> 02:09:30,605
Receive criticism from the people of the W3C above, modify etcetera ...

1412
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:32,253
And to make what standards.

1413
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:34,988
So that is the approach -

1414
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:39,525
but that is the architecture.

1415
02:09:41,327 --> 02:09:43,061
Then, I know more or are come the names.

1416
02:09:43,931 --> 02:09:44,369
But brief ...

1417
02:09:45,254 --> 02:09:46,758
Power, that is the kernel.

1418
02:09:47,064 --> 02:09:49,338
So that is a Linux kernel.

1419
02:09:49,607 --> 02:09:53,668
It is party to the departure of a kernel Android in which it was removed to almost everything.

1420
02:09:54,645 --> 02:09:59,012
It was removed from the JVM, has been removed from the Webkit engine, it has removed full full of things.

1421
02:09:59,254 --> 02:10:03,387
And now we are faced with an engine that made 17 mega i think, with a kernel which is 17 mega.

1422
02:10:03,387 --> 02:10:04,758
So, there is really nothing in it more.

1423
02:10:05,088 --> 02:10:12,414
And at a given time it went a little too far, it was hard, it had even more of what to do, finally, there one can even more edit a file with what was inside.

1424
02:10:12,791 --> 02:10:15,125
It must be the edit in remote, finally ...

1425
02:10:15,382 --> 02:10:17,294
It had been a violent hair.

1426
02:10:17,461 --> 02:10:19,326
But when in doubt, many prefer to remove too much than not enough.

1427
02:10:22,047 --> 02:10:25,325
The party noble we are going to say, it is Gecko.

1428
02:10:25,559 --> 02:10:31,309
Therefore, This is the motor that rotates Firefox on the machines of the most discerning of entered you.

1429
02:10:31,591 --> 02:10:37,013
And, with all these Web API, all these device API.

1430
02:10:37,263 --> 02:10:40,838
So here I know not what our graphic designers have wanted to represent here.

1431
02:10:41,047 --> 02:10:48,093
well, This is obviously the phone API, this is the API of the settings, the sound API, SMS, picture ... finally well.

1432
02:10:48,687 --> 02:10:50,918
Then, it was not of APIS for explorer of the files.

1433
02:10:51,103 --> 02:10:55,742
it's one of the big differences between making a Web application and make a desktop application classic.

1434
02:10:56,911 --> 02:11:02,701
Roughly, I think most of you do not want a Web site can access your files on desktop.

1435
02:11:02,966 --> 02:11:04,462
it seem almost obvious.

1436
02:11:04,662 --> 02:11:13,813
On the other hand, if you even if you choose with a button "Choose File", a file on your desktop, at that time you have made the approach of the choose you-even, of the select.

1437
02:11:14,104 --> 02:11:19,230
At this point, you agree to the Web site to do something.

1438
02:11:19,471 --> 02:11:21,190
But in short, it was full of restrictions such like this.

1439
02:11:21,375 --> 02:11:23,085
So typically, the API files it is very frustrating

1440
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:28,478
the Mr. which is in more than he can explain more of things that what I should know about the API files.

1441
02:11:28,768 --> 02:11:31,886
So I know that this is not the API files since it is not of the API files.

1442
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:33,606
By contrast, it may be media or I do not know what.

1443
02:11:33,984 --> 02:11:39,326
Or perhaps that just our graphic designers who I stole this hardware of press, have not understood that there was no API files.

1444
02:11:40,631 --> 02:11:41,229
May-be.

1445
02:11:41,663 --> 02:11:42,445
I know nothing.

1446
02:11:42,687 --> 02:11:46,637
In any case, the ugly part is that there are much more than that of the specific API.

1447
02:11:46,992 --> 02:11:49,853
It was a really good big horde.

1448
02:11:51,888 --> 02:11:52,886
Therefore,

1449
02:11:53,295 --> 02:11:57,165
it roughly, it is a party that is done ...

1450
02:11:57,335 --> 02:12:00,341
Near, finally in collaboration with the manufacturers.

1451
02:12:00,806 --> 02:12:06,582
this, that is what is being done globally in the offices in California but also a little in Paris.

1452
02:12:07,112 --> 02:12:08,934
David, typically, bump on this part here.

1453
02:12:10,032 --> 02:12:12,622
And that is the part that should interest you you.

1454
02:12:13,048 --> 02:12:15,205
And I hope full of people.

1455
02:12:15,799 --> 02:12:20,438
It is the user interface part, so that is called Gaia.

1456
02:12:20,718 --> 02:12:22,318
But good, Gaia is a password-suitcase.

1457
02:12:22,535 --> 02:12:28,581
All the visible part of the phone, this are the Web applications.

1458
02:12:30,656 --> 02:12:37,445
And it was the applications that are delivered with the original phone, therefore all this set of applications it is called Gaia.

1459
02:12:38,279 --> 02:12:44,206
But y'has full of applications that are removed or added at the last moment and will be placed at the marketplace at the place.

1460
02:12:44,496 --> 02:12:51,453
Y'a not to differences, true differences between an application of the marketplace or a Mozilla application Gaia in fact.

1461
02:12:51,631 --> 02:12:54,470
The difference is that the application Gaia it will be delivered in the phone by default.

1462
02:12:55,392 --> 02:12:58,630
But, it is a Web application as another.

1463
02:12:58,903 --> 02:12:59,941
Finally as another ...

1464
02:13:01,735 --> 02:13:05,829
Who can take advantage of these APIS, the essential difference is this.

1465
02:13:09,295 --> 02:13:13,630
So there it is, to go back a little on Power for the most seasoned of between you.

1466
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:19,238
It was a piece of ... of abstraction layer, of hardware abstraction layer.

1467
02:13:19,447 --> 02:13:27,629
So overall, the API of power, it serves us to ensure that the people who sequels on Gecko do not have too much to worry about the hardware.

1468
02:13:27,983 --> 02:13:32,853
Therefore it was of the teams that sequels only for, we are going to say, the hardware compatibility of the phone.

1469
02:13:33,239 --> 02:13:38,398
Therefore, the role of this API power it is to expose the hardware API to Gecko.

1470
02:13:40,384 --> 02:13:42,821
Gecko, i don't know why it is presented yet but ...

1471
02:13:46,848 --> 02:13:48,605
The best javascript engine of the world.

1472
02:13:48,966 --> 02:13:51,166
Almost the best rendering engine of the world.

1473
02:13:51,432 --> 02:13:52,189
It's being worked on.

1474
02:13:52,680 --> 02:14:03,462
And especially there, the Gecko that we will chipper in FirefoxOS, this is a Gecko which exposes a large number of APIS to control your device.

1475
02:14:03,597 --> 02:14:07,686
Which are not enabled by default in the desktop version, on the laptop.

1476
02:14:09,304 --> 02:14:10,318
And therefore Gaia ...

1477
02:14:11,399 --> 02:14:12,246
Then ...

1478
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,286
There'a a term in fact ...

1479
02:14:14,447 --> 02:14:16,365
which is rather unfortunate, it is ....

1480
02:14:17,151 --> 02:14:20,350
the term "Webapps" because in fact we never know too what does it means the word "Webapps".

1481
02:14:20,687 --> 02:14:23,853
A Web application, it may be something that ...

1482
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:26,230
which happens entirely on the side of the server.

1483
02:14:26,512 --> 02:14:28,854
And on which finally you do not have too much control.

1484
02:14:29,824 --> 02:14:38,237
And, in fact, when we speak of "Webapp" in the draft FirefoxOS, we are talking about Web applications which turn fully on the phone.

1485
02:14:38,751 --> 02:14:42,750
Therefore, we used the latest gadgets of HTML5.

1486
02:14:43,328 --> 02:14:47,677
As "offline cache", sometimes "localstorage" when it is left go.

1487
02:14:48,775 --> 02:14:51,605
And so these are applications which run entirely on your phone.

1488
02:14:51,854 --> 02:14:55,918
If, if there is no network, as it is often the case here, it works anyway.

1489
02:14:56,711 --> 02:15:03,758
Therefore, when we talk of "Open WebApp" or "WebApp" in the rest of this presentation, that is the kind of Web application that is talked about.

1490
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:08,670
Therefore, I believe that the list is not complete because it has been added since.

1491
02:15:08,863 --> 02:15:16,870
But that is an overview of all of the APIS that we had to implement in GAIA.

1492
02:15:17,824 --> 02:15:23,189
And the more crazy is that every time we made the documents for the W3C, to explain what is being done.

1493
02:15:23,535 --> 02:15:26,222
And have their feedback because they want to ...

1494
02:15:26,375 --> 02:15:30,798
The aim of the game, is that all this set of APIS will become a standard.

1495
02:15:31,152 --> 02:15:34,398
It is at least as important as having a phone functional for us.

1496
02:15:38,968 --> 02:15:41,590
this, this is the table which is fear.
In particulary to me.

1497
02:15:41,814 --> 02:15:43,278
Because this is a remap.

1498
02:15:44,174 --> 02:15:46,390
But overall it explained you how it works

1499
02:15:47,503 --> 02:15:50,414
We have all these APIS there therefore you had a preview.

1500
02:15:50,648 --> 02:15:52,870
well, there has thought about it, it implements them.

1501
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:59,701
And it was our colleagues, mainly in California, which have bump above.

1502
02:15:59,919 --> 02:16:01,126
For the implement not bad.

1503
02:16:01,513 --> 02:16:04,973
And during this time, we in Paris ...

1504
02:16:06,448 --> 02:16:08,718
We had people who have made spec.

1505
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:14,294
Then UX, user experienced, this is all that is ergonomics software.

1506
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:19,453
They did, they have imagined how to behave the applications, all of this.

1507
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:20,805
They have been implemented.

1508
02:16:21,224 --> 02:16:23,111
And currently it is in this phase.

1509
02:16:23,504 --> 02:16:27,078
That is to say that it has frozen our features.

1510
02:16:27,312 --> 02:16:29,223
We no longer returns no new functionality.

1511
02:16:29,349 --> 02:16:32,486
It is in the process of debugging both simple and, to refine.

1512
02:16:32,725 --> 02:16:34,254
And to solve the bugs ...

1513
02:16:34,423 --> 02:16:38,958
Finally, the stories of performance, the glitch of display and and so on.

1514
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:40,501
And, it was of the job.

1515
02:16:41,327 --> 02:16:44,550
The good news is that I think that we announced that we were entitled to a month of no longer there.

1516
02:16:45,648 --> 02:16:46,982
But overall, that is.

1517
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:52,533
December: GAIA v1 is on the rails.

1518
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:58,125
After y'a whole process complicated for it past the certification authority, for that it can be placed on the market.

1519
02:16:58,391 --> 02:17:02,005
Because a mobile phone that is not quite a computer as another.

1520
02:17:03,113 --> 02:17:05,389
And we will begin already working on GAIA v2.

1521
02:17:07,488 --> 02:17:09,303
For ... the year after.

1522
02:17:09,647 --> 02:17:11,277
Therefore, GAIA v1 that it will get there.

1523
02:17:11,542 --> 02:17:14,838
It should be shipped, it will begin by Brazil.

1524
02:17:16,893 --> 02:17:18,539
Around the spring-summer next.

1525
02:17:32,317 --> 02:17:35,844
All the update for the moment is done at the computer

1526
02:17:39,254 --> 02:17:41,812
for the moment, the only thing that we know not to update this is the part here.

1527
02:17:44,095 --> 02:17:45,188
And, we ...

1528
02:17:46,517 --> 02:17:48,581
As it is in phase of stabilization there.

1529
02:17:49,118 --> 02:17:53,896
It was already the guys among us who refuse to flash their phone.

1530
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:58,416
Typically there, and everywhere where i moved, i can't happen to do in the RER or in the metro.

1531
02:17:58,819 --> 02:18:02,417
I have an idea, i the code and I have my USB cord, i fuiiiiiiit ...

1532
02:18:02,681 --> 02:18:05,040
And I send in the phone, it takes 10 seconds.

1533
02:18:05,418 --> 02:18:08,888
And, finally, the fact of the send, the fact of the encode that, unfortunately takes more time.

1534
02:18:09,418 --> 02:18:18,176
And, it was the guys among us who say: "nan but now it is finished, I refused to connect my phone to a computer. it must works".

1535
02:18:18,473 --> 02:18:27,824
Therefore, there is the time of the case a hair painful, or in fact a version bugguee is arrival and has broken tips.

1536
02:18:27,985 --> 02:18:33,672
And suddenly we are trying to reflect, to know how we can do, by successive update, to resolve the problem.

1537
02:18:34,723 --> 02:18:37,281
This is a new profession what, I am not sure of the love that one.

1538
02:18:37,555 --> 02:18:40,025
But ya get you there.

1539
02:18:40,258 --> 02:18:41,129
It is done globally.

1540
02:18:41,466 --> 02:18:44,207
The only hint for which for the moment we know not too how do, this is the part here.

1541
02:18:44,402 --> 02:18:48,072
This part for the time being, I am not too sure what is planned to make.

1542
02:18:48,354 --> 02:18:50,040
I am a little more worried about it.

1543
02:18:50,217 --> 02:18:51,680
But otherwise it is capable of peter all the rest.

1544
02:18:53,635 --> 02:18:55,672
It has frozen the version of Gecko that we will shipped.

1545
02:18:56,099 --> 02:18:58,176
This is the Gecko 18.

1546
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:04,024
Therefore it is the firefox which is currently in version Aurora, who will be the firefox stable in 12 weeks, in 3 months.

1547
02:19:04,394 --> 02:19:12,153
Therefore, all of this normally, y'has no reason to be more worried about that ...

1548
02:19:17,515 --> 02:19:20,810
For the moment, there'a a device.

1549
02:19:21,330 --> 02:19:23,295
Finally a terminal, we know not yet exactly which.

1550
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:28,945
But the first phase of deployment of firefoxos, it will be:

1551
02:19:29,061 --> 02:19:34,327
a device, which will be sold in Brazil and it is hoped that this will be sold quite well.

1552
02:19:34,537 --> 02:19:41,535
And that it will allow us to see how it is able to make updates in several million units like that in one shot.

1553
02:19:41,802 --> 02:19:48,400
Currently, there are fact updates on, as said David all at the time, on a half-billion posts every 6 weeks.

1554
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:50,484
Therefore, we can't be more afraid that.

1555
02:19:50,702 --> 02:19:52,125
What we fear is to ...

1556
02:19:52,691 --> 02:19:54,473
It is easy to make an update on a desktop.

1557
02:19:54,835 --> 02:20:00,648
On a country like Brazil or the latin america more generally or the connectivity is not always at the top ...

1558
02:20:00,931 --> 02:20:09,589
Or the guy it may find itself in its end-package data then he has not finished to download its updates, etcetera, etcetera ...

1559
02:20:10,102 --> 02:20:12,363
It was ... not bad for small ...

1560
02:20:12,363 --> 02:20:12,920
Finally ...

1561
02:20:14,188 --> 02:20:15,683
We will certainly discover problems.

1562
02:20:16,436 --> 02:20:17,192
I think.

1563
02:20:17,969 --> 02:20:19,713
There is no reason this happen well on ths first try.

1564
02:20:24,977 --> 02:20:30,125
Well, we aren't doing it because we can do it.

1565
02:20:30,569 --> 02:20:33,552
Y'a not bad development, finally of things that are happening in Web.

1566
02:20:34,514 --> 02:20:42,620
Or, when the question is asked: But why you do this in a Web browser while it exists in the desktop applications?

1567
02:20:43,076 --> 02:20:46,177
Often the guy he said, because I could not do that, then I am.

1568
02:20:47,286 --> 02:20:50,142
There'a a little of that, it didn't start from that at the beginning.

1569
02:20:50,366 --> 02:21:01,878
But, clearly, if it is done and that it is investing as much time and energy there, it is because it is of benefit to the developer which one believes a lot.

1570
02:21:02,705 --> 02:21:08,798
The first of these benefits, is that it is easy to begin to develop for a mobile application type firefoxos.

1571
02:21:09,126 --> 02:21:14,897
Is it there are some that have already developed applications for Android or for IOS? Among you.

1572
02:21:15,187 --> 02:21:16,201
Android?
IOS?

1573
02:21:17,764 --> 02:21:18,442
Android?

1574
02:21:19,832 --> 02:21:25,675
It is not just the happiness the hint Android there, with their ... thou was using the Eclipse plugin?

1575
02:21:26,119 --> 02:21:33,224
it make us dream, doesn't it?
Here, there is a need for a text editor.

1576
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:35,215
And a browser.

1577
02:21:35,414 --> 02:21:38,895
IOS, it is already a problem better bloody their hint.

1578
02:21:39,023 --> 02:21:42,809
Because they have a cruise control device or we can play and all but oh well.

1579
02:21:42,934 --> 02:21:48,757
It must be ... a Mac, it must be the license Xcode and it should be.. $100 I think ...

1580
02:21:57,238 --> 02:21:59,606
Clearly, we the idea, is that it can ...

1581
02:22:00,118 --> 02:22:01,641
It is aimed at the emerging markets.

1582
02:22:01,885 --> 02:22:06,049
We would like that the whole population of the world can create its own mobile applications.

1583
02:22:06,225 --> 02:22:09,155
It is the people who will not know the desktop in fact.

1584
02:22:09,303 --> 02:22:15,702
They arrive in this golden age of the information directly from the tablet, the mobile and all.

1585
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:19,343
And we want to not put the barrier of entry too high for them.

1586
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:21,801
They can develop their own stuff like that, fos!

1587
02:22:22,407 --> 02:22:23,906
Especially now that we can do, y'a not of reasons to be emmerder.

1588
02:22:25,763 --> 02:22:27,650
The development environments already exist.

1589
02:22:28,342 --> 02:22:30,716
well, overall, it is firebug.

1590
02:22:30,966 --> 02:22:36,220
And, uh, y'has plenty of other things for those who are shims in Web development, JS.

1591
02:22:36,473 --> 02:22:41,151
Y'a of the frameworks, y'a of languages, including such as JS, finally y'has full of things.

1592
02:22:41,426 --> 02:22:42,979
That we like it or not, finally it exists

1593
02:22:44,057 --> 02:22:56,412
and then, finally, it was a way that is not evil, which is quite pertinent to solve the problem of what the "Appleistes" call the fragmentation of the Android Market.

1594
02:22:56,749 --> 02:23:03,381
In fact, they hate work on Android because they do not know in advance that it will be the resolution, that it will be the power of calculation of the terminal etcetera ...

1595
02:23:03,654 --> 02:23:06,091
When we worked on IOS, normally we know.

1596
02:23:06,333 --> 02:23:07,012
It is very close to it.

1597
02:23:07,293 --> 02:23:08,636
When we worked at Android, we know not.

1598
02:23:09,709 --> 02:23:16,227
Hey well we said it knows not but they don't care because it is accustomed to doing this, it is accustomed to make design reagents in CSS.

1599
02:23:16,531 --> 02:23:20,878
It uses CSS3 media queries to adapt to different resolutions.

1600
02:23:21,177 --> 02:23:22,730
Overall, the approach that is:

1601
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:29,154
we began by creating an application for the case the more penalizing, that is to say the device the one that I have in the pocket.

1602
02:23:29,247 --> 02:23:33,347
The one who has the lowest CPU, which has the screen the more rotten ...

1603
02:23:33,519 --> 02:23:43,298
And after added to coup of media queries of features as the screen is larger, that the CPU gives us more of things, etcetera ...

1604
02:23:43,524 --> 02:23:45,759
Therefore, it is finally not bad.

1605
02:23:46,228 --> 02:23:54,987
We broken finally the dependence on the platform and browser, you break the dependence to the marketplace, including David spoke to you.

1606
02:23:56,140 --> 02:23:57,140
And yes, it works offline.

1607
02:23:57,355 --> 02:24:01,050
It is not because it makes the HTML that it was necessarily need an Internet connection.

1608
02:24:04,923 --> 02:24:06,090
Then, that is part ...

1609
02:24:09,131 --> 02:24:10,571
that is part ...

1610
02:24:11,788 --> 02:24:14,978
It is really because it is Mozilla that can happen like this.

1611
02:24:15,251 --> 02:24:20,513
The big difference between Maemo, Tizen, now Sea and company.

1612
02:24:20,691 --> 02:24:27,187
This whole lineage here of OS for mobile which were based on a Linux kernel also and who also used dance mixes Web ...

1613
02:24:27,396 --> 02:24:30,081
WebOS typically, falls into this category here.

1614
02:24:31,303 --> 02:24:38,739
It is that they had their specific APIS for the hardware and the operating system more than the techno Web.

1615
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:41,075
What makes that to develop for these machines that he had known the two.

1616
02:24:42,995 --> 02:24:44,747
It was well seen to know the two in any case.

1617
02:24:44,939 --> 02:24:57,273
We, is prohibited, even for us, because we could very well, y'has full of time or will have you tearing your hair, it loses the weeks of developments for a hint that you could do with a few lines of XPCOM or stuff like that.

1618
02:24:58,333 --> 02:25:02,974
And, the equivalent of the NaCL of Google, it knows how to do this at home Mozilla.

1619
02:25:03,207 --> 02:25:07,250
It is forbidden to do that because the idea is to make the Web Only.

1620
02:25:07,459 --> 02:25:11,368
Therefore, if there is something that we know not to do that, that is a bug, it is not normal.

1621
02:25:11,485 --> 02:25:13,898
Therefore it is something that should be corrected at the level of Gecko.

1622
02:25:14,092 --> 02:25:17,843
So when y'has something that we know not to do on the side of GAIA, there the corrected in Gecko.

1623
02:25:17,979 --> 02:25:25,857
Therefore, when we want to optimize our applications for devices really, really in vile price.

1624
02:25:26,296 --> 02:25:28,428
Hey well it obliges us to advance the Gecko engine.

1625
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:30,341
Because it is necessary to optimize its rendering.

1626
02:25:31,532 --> 02:25:36,732
We need to ensure that when there is a need for an API, for example to check the energy consumption, etcetera ...

1627
02:25:36,945 --> 02:25:43,894
And well it is necessary to ensure that this API is defined in Gecko, proposed to the W3C, standardized and implemented in the device.

1628
02:25:44,093 --> 02:25:46,445
So we made overall things properly.

1629
02:25:46,913 --> 02:25:53,419
Everything is done to ensure that the development of the Web development remains as simple as possible to the final.

1630
02:25:54,911 --> 02:26:01,979
Then, in the tricks that we are going to have to look as it is to ensure that the developer tools operate on the remote device.

1631
02:26:02,189 --> 02:26:04,631
So that is typically the hint which made me crazy on Android.

1632
02:26:04,873 --> 02:26:06,910
Which market a hair better on IOS.

1633
02:26:07,135 --> 02:26:19,167
But overall, if I could turn my firebug on the device through the USB cable, it is when even vahchement better than the alternatives xcode or android.

1634
02:26:19,711 --> 02:26:21,687
Then, it is in train to arrive.

1635
02:26:22,351 --> 02:26:23,647
We started to play with this week.

1636
02:26:23,855 --> 02:26:25,039
I would have liked to do a demo but ...

1637
02:26:26,167 --> 02:26:26,976
It is not yet well dry.

1638
02:26:29,631 --> 02:26:37,391
More generally, one realizes that make applications, a complete system in javascript, html, JS. ..

1639
02:26:38,887 --> 02:26:41,749
HTML, CSS, it is not always simple.

1640
02:26:41,895 --> 02:26:43,726
It is of time even a hair frustrating.

1641
02:26:43,919 --> 02:26:49,166
And, in fact, it was said but we could resolve it with a javascript framework.

1642
02:26:50,382 --> 02:26:54,526
But typically, it will be said again, this is a decision that was made from the beginning of the project ...

1643
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:58,350
If you have to make a framework, to new is that it is wrong.

1644
02:26:58,567 --> 02:27:01,310
Therefore, it should work "from scratch", like this.

1645
02:27:01,495 --> 02:27:05,624
The big difference between two languages that are used not bad server side currently.

1646
02:27:06,012 --> 02:27:08,248
Between Python and PHP, finally there is full of differences.

1647
02:27:08,497 --> 02:27:18,449
But, one of the major difference is that in PHP it had to be made in the framework because y'had of things which have been designed a little through the departure and on which they have not wanted to go back.

1648
02:27:18,731 --> 02:27:23,160
It is this that allows your PHP application it is written one day and in two years it will continue to rotate.

1649
02:27:23,329 --> 02:27:26,824
And that by against the code will be moderately class to read.

1650
02:27:26,946 --> 02:27:29,761
Python side, they have said they want to that the code is clean.

1651
02:27:29,890 --> 02:27:32,607
Therefore, if there is a need for frameworks, is that we have been missed.

1652
02:27:32,778 --> 02:27:35,225
Therefore, suddenly it rewrites the language.

1653
02:27:35,462 --> 02:27:38,889
I know not if you have tried to migrate your scripts python 2.7 to python 3 ...

1654
02:27:39,033 --> 02:27:41,219
it hurts.

1655
02:27:41,353 --> 02:27:58,388
Therefore, it tries to reflect on how is it that we could move incrementally without breaking the existing tools to make the development not just that of a few applications like this but of an entire system of information in HTML, CSS, JS.

1656
02:27:59,388 --> 02:28:00,608
Y'has ideas which emerge.

1657
02:28:00,785 --> 02:28:04,346
Each time it is the same Italy at Mozilla, we want this to be a standard.

1658
02:28:04,568 --> 02:28:09,554
We want to that the standard is implementable by all the world, by Microsoft, Google, Apple, others ...

1659
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:15,249
There typically we hope that things will bring us something on the Web Open Apps.

1660
02:28:15,452 --> 02:28:23,770
But overall that is, all that stuff serves us to ensure that the Web can really become a development platform for the mobile.

1661
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:28,106
Then, a few figures in passing.

1662
02:28:28,346 --> 02:28:32,514
The columns are not to scale because I am no one ... for the stories of computer graphics.

1663
02:28:33,283 --> 02:28:33,986
But y'a ...

1664
02:28:35,284 --> 02:28:41,066
approximately 100,000 applications ios, 450,000 android and 8 million of Web applications in any kind.

1665
02:28:41,355 --> 02:28:43,074
It is a figure a little suitcase.

1666
02:28:43,354 --> 02:28:49,441
What is clear is that, for the moment, it is far from having a park of applications as high as on iOS or android.

1667
02:28:49,627 --> 02:28:55,194
By contrast, what is kept in head, as it is not a non-profit corporation, it is not non-press more.

1668
02:28:56,164 --> 02:29:03,290
We know that the potential is high. We know that in the long term it should be possible to have many more applications than on IOS and on Android.

1669
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:10,938
And with this ongoing process you want to standardize everything that adds, everything that is needed to make the Web development.

1670
02:29:11,764 --> 02:29:18,402
It is also hoped that IOS and Android reimplementeront perhaps not all of our APIs but at least the APIs which will be the most used.

1671
02:29:18,595 --> 02:29:33,274
And that it will therefore to a maximum of applications to be developed only once in HTML and that they work as, overall, what has been done to the standards of the Web since the end of years 90.

1672
02:29:47,187 --> 02:29:59,898
Clearly, clearly, Google, their hint, for them the Web it is their work environment so, the more we will know how to make pure Web applications more than they would be interested.

1673
02:30:00,007 --> 02:30:08,485
The only thing that can annoy a little it is Apple but Apple using the engines mostly developed by Google, finally I think to WebKit.

1674
02:30:10,007 --> 02:30:11,301
They will follow, whether they want to or not.

1675
02:30:22,759 --> 02:30:26,365
Then, just to show that I am not in the process of you fake, I have a telephone.

1676
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:33,347
The brand is "Pomaro"
Did you see?

1677
02:30:37,083 --> 02:30:38,307
And I, then ...

1678
02:30:59,455 --> 02:31:00,468
I believe in it!

1679
02:31:13,563 --> 02:31:23,952
Then, This is a ... we are going to say that it is a species of firefox without control, it is just a surface rendering, therefore ac, ac is downloaded on the website of Mozilla.

1680
02:31:24,274 --> 02:31:25,177
You can test it yourself.

1681
02:31:31,602 --> 02:31:39,337
Therefore, the small hint that amuses me is that this is the true level of battery of my laptop because it is the API Battery and that it is implemented and that that is.

1682
02:31:39,595 --> 02:31:41,040
Suddenly I have my battery level.

1683
02:31:42,266 --> 02:31:47,305
Uh, a small overview of applications, so it is therefore of the HTML.

1684
02:31:47,587 --> 02:31:56,310
Here I present to you the application "Settings" because it was developed by people well and because I want to remove any of the following lock of the screen.

1685
02:31:56,824 --> 02:31:58,383
You will understand why in not long ago.

1686
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:02,589
Therefore, uh ...

1687
02:32:06,064 --> 02:32:08,247
this, this will not do so, no it will not do so ...

1688
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:15,853
Y'has full of tricks which the coup are not ... exploited, who are not exposed by the keyboard so that is typically ...

1689
02:32:16,504 --> 02:32:20,748
small hint classic, you know the buttons Select to make a drag &amp; drop it box

1690
02:32:21,622 --> 02:32:27,444
in mobile this becomes that, then ideally it should be aligned properly and not overflow, and not to wind up like that.

1691
02:32:27,814 --> 02:32:31,234
But that is just because I have not yet am the Patch that goes well

1692
02:32:32,028 --> 02:32:35,034
but that is how it chooses the stuff like that -

1693
02:32:35,388 --> 02:32:37,250
but that is the buttons, it is of conventional checkbox -

1694
02:32:37,588 --> 02:32:39,969
but that is an input type=range

1695
02:32:40,203 --> 02:32:43,329
all that it is standard HTML elements in fact.

1696
02:32:43,523 --> 02:32:55,089
Then, what we lack is the "Home" button , i have on my hint, hop i come back to the "Home" but there stupidly y'a as a kind of bug what.

1697
02:32:55,450 --> 02:32:57,650
And what is cool is paf, it restarts as soon as possible.

1698
02:32:57,859 --> 02:33:00,460
And that, in addition it has removed the screen lock so it is faster

1699
02:33:01,761 --> 02:33:07,822
then, these are a few applications, I think I have the time, I will sit down.

1700
02:33:10,615 --> 02:33:16,038
It is the things that you can quickly test on your ... by downloading that.

1701
02:33:17,928 --> 02:33:26,958
It is overall, there is party on the idea that we wanted to for all of our applications a interface as minimalist as possible, that we wanted to give ... focus on the content.

1702
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:28,203
Hop here!

1703
02:33:29,458 --> 02:33:39,123
So, each time we have wanted to do the relatively simple application.

1704
02:33:40,212 --> 02:33:41,539
Then, I know more how do i get out of this one.

1705
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:44,643
It must be like this I think.
That is, jpaf!

1706
02:33:47,086 --> 02:33:49,532
Then, for the turn, it is simple, it has a button "Edit", then tac.

1707
02:33:49,878 --> 02:33:53,491
And as you see, it is not yet quite finished to be implemented

1708
02:33:56,805 --> 02:33:59,335
i believe that we can not get out because of a "fork" at the con

1709
02:34:01,943 --> 02:34:04,326
but fortunately, paf, it restarts udderly quickly -

1710
02:34:06,256 --> 02:34:07,945
but that is cool as it restarts as quickly as

1711
02:34:11,095 --> 02:34:13,076
the FM radio i thought it was cool

1712
02:34:14,814 --> 02:34:19,275
There, too, as it can be put of ... would like 89.3

1713
02:34:21,197 --> 02:34:25,116
Ok, obviously you hear nothing because I have no radios in the machin there but on the principle, it is class.

1714
02:34:27,886 --> 02:34:30,132
I am really sorry for the listening, but ...

1715
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:34,420
The agenda, ah the agenda this fact party applications which are all recent.

1716
02:34:36,165 --> 02:34:37,091
Because this one

1717
02:34:38,142 --> 02:34:40,844
already it has not need a phone to work.

1718
02:34:41,413 --> 02:34:44,228
She must walk niquel in your PC.

1719
02:34:44,429 --> 02:34:50,092
I am even virtually certain that it is usable or not really far what ...

1720
02:34:50,277 --> 02:34:52,468
It can replace your current calendar manager.

1721
02:34:53,461 --> 02:35:01,667
It is made in such a way as to almost intelligent and it is in the process of looking at how we can ensure that on the PC, it make a side bar in fact.

1722
02:35:02,573 --> 02:35:07,405
On the PC it was more of place so suddenly it would like to make a interface multi-panels from the beginning ....

1723
02:35:08,248 --> 02:35:17,925
And may be present views a little different but it is really hard work of stylist so if y'in has among you who are tinkerers in CSS and all.

1724
02:35:18,111 --> 02:35:23,326
This Calendar application, you can use right now on a Desktop and begin to play with.

1725
02:35:23,552 --> 02:35:27,588
Then, by against for the code, it is the code to the framework, it is a Model-view -Controller

1726
02:35:28,966 --> 02:35:29,853
Y'are fans ...

1727
02:35:30,839 --> 02:35:32,028
Unfortunately it is not my case.

1728
02:35:32,950 --> 02:35:37,253
But side CSS in any case, it is done well.

1729
02:35:37,511 --> 02:35:46,230
The email application is in the same delirium, the email application it is made by a former home of thunderbird which bump now full time to make an application email in HTML5.

1730
02:35:46,655 --> 02:35:51,445
And uh ... the joke they made him about 10 times per day and he must finish by tired.

1731
02:35:51,639 --> 02:35:53,725
Is the fact that he said but when is it stopped thunderbird to do this?

1732
02:35:55,992 --> 02:35:59,118
It happens ...
A student: Excusez-moi, ...

1733
02:36:04,935 --> 02:36:14,589
In fact there is a standard API already on the Web therefore the geotagging it was ... it was the triangulation Wi-fi, I do not know on what it's base on.

1734
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:19,733
But it was a GPS bus in the ... in the device that is there.

1735
02:36:20,175 --> 02:36:22,452
Therefore it is located with the GPS.

1736
02:36:23,013 --> 02:36:26,091
And after, if by platform, thou hear ....

1737
02:36:27,725 --> 02:36:28,547
Ah, it is another thing ...

1738
02:36:30,069 --> 02:36:32,156
Currently, if it is running, we used NokiaMaps

1739
02:36:33,365 --> 02:36:36,164
this can be because if there is no connection to the Net, it was not a map.

1740
02:36:37,222 --> 02:36:40,748
Therefore it is not very happy, but it works.

1741
02:36:43,517 --> 02:36:44,156
So it is a clock.

1742
02:36:46,933 --> 02:36:47,708
It is of the SVG.

1743
02:36:48,342 --> 02:36:52,228
I find this class. I prefer this one who market as well.

1744
02:36:54,406 --> 02:36:57,980
Therefore it has alarms and I cannot resist the pleasure to show you the time selector.

1745
02:37:03,813 --> 02:37:06,932
I am going to put an alarm at that time wish, it will wake me up.

1746
02:37:11,613 --> 02:37:15,523
Forgiveness?
Ouai, perhaps

1747
02:37:31,203 --> 02:37:31,859
video Application ...

1748
02:37:36,452 --> 02:37:40,476
That is ... with the slider and all ...

1749
02:37:41,166 --> 02:37:45,084
Then necessarily if they could be the switch it would better.

1750
02:37:45,398 --> 02:37:48,635
Here, a video in this sense in portrait mode it makes a little twit.

1751
02:37:51,085 --> 02:38:06,524
In the small revolutions made there above is that we know how to read the videos to mp4 audio in mp3 if it is decoded by the hardware of this.

1752
02:38:07,609 --> 02:38:15,912
Therefore we know always not do it .... finally we not know how to do that, it is prohibited to do this on the desktop for reasons of ethics, politics, I know not too ...

1753
02:38:17,034 --> 02:38:19,863
On the device, it arises less from questions, it is done ...

1754
02:38:21,593 --> 02:38:27,383
The application "Music", I know not at all how works the applications "Music" of IOS and company.

1755
02:38:28,370 --> 02:38:29,960
I found really nice.

1756
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:31,472
Then unfortunately ...

1757
02:38:32,641 --> 02:38:36,423
My library is a hair too ... too long.

1758
02:38:36,697 --> 02:38:39,816
I do not know why he has lost the images want, it could be a bug for this evening.

1759
02:38:40,065 --> 02:38:43,824
But that is it is a mosaic of all ... of all these tricks here.

1760
02:38:44,345 --> 02:38:49,168
And then, stupidly, just because it must be in FLAC and that ...

1761
02:38:49,425 --> 02:38:53,943
I know not decode the FLAC natively with this laptop it will not be able you sing it.

1762
02:38:55,018 --> 02:38:56,264
But on the device it works well -

1763
02:38:56,586 --> 02:38:59,633
but that is a design that i found fairly successfully.

1764
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:03,212
And it was when even the conventional lists ...

1765
02:39:03,212 --> 02:39:04,728
A student: it makes you think the tiles ...

1766
02:39:05,521 --> 02:39:07,513
Ouai, it makes you think the tiles Windows ouai ...

1767
02:39:07,777 --> 02:39:09,672
Ouai, i am intent ...

1768
02:39:19,242 --> 02:39:21,327
Well, it makes it not too because in fact ...

1769
02:39:21,503 --> 02:39:23,935
in the meta-data files MP3, FLAC and company ...

1770
02:39:24,185 --> 02:39:27,518
y'has images, in general 200 by 200 and all of a sudden ...

1771
02:39:29,241 --> 02:39:30,801
in fact it worked in the RER everything to the hour stupidly ...

1772
02:39:30,995 --> 02:39:31,970
there it no longer works, I know not why ...

1773
02:39:32,419 --> 02:39:39,474
And it was the album art but with a color by top which is in fact ...

1774
02:39:40,164 --> 02:39:43,026
a kind of size as a function of some tricks that we have played recently ...

1775
02:39:43,218 --> 02:39:44,218
that we love etcetera ...

1776
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:49,802
The size ... the songs that we played regularly take 4 seater instead one ....

1777
02:39:49,994 --> 02:39:52,887
Finally, they are pleased i found the guy of the staff

1778
02:39:54,499 --> 02:39:56,915
and, also that it works on the desktop.

1779
02:39:57,317 --> 02:40:03,369
The default is that it must be by the OGG in desktop because ...

1780
02:40:03,723 --> 02:40:05,761
Unless you have the hardware support for the decode the MP3 player.

1781
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:13,787
I restarted a last time, I don't know if y'a to other applications that are worth the coup to be shown.

1782
02:40:14,828 --> 02:40:16,506
You will forgive me if I not show you the calculator ...

1783
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:21,378
Oh god, here you go, this is the calculator.

1784
02:40:26,188 --> 02:40:26,770
Ouai!

1785
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:38,033
It is damned better in true, because it was not the real police, it has a police that it was done deliberately to mobile, but that obviously i not on the machin there.

1786
02:40:38,411 --> 02:40:39,730
Therefore in true she is better.

1787
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:43,955
Ah, so now I would like to show you and then we will end up there above..

1788
02:40:44,179 --> 02:40:47,234
The hint that I find really class on this project ...

1789
02:41:11,404 --> 02:41:15,981
So there it is, it is called "lioex" but in fact it is a firefox ???

1790
02:41:15,791 --> 02:41:21,167
It is just a separate branch for a hair test tips of interface.

1791
02:41:22,926 --> 02:41:27,906
Therefore, you locate the URL, then in fact to have this URL here I am doing a bit of debug to Gaia.

1792
02:41:28,138 --> 02:41:30,794
it is done in ruby, debug equal 1 space make ... Fos!

1793
02:41:31,418 --> 02:41:32,044
And ...

1794
02:41:33,004 --> 02:41:40,957
it creates a profile in which y'a any Gaia and in which y'has an extension that allows you to make a pseudo server ...

1795
02:41:41,293 --> 02:41:42,060
Finally brief ...

1796
02:41:42,324 --> 02:41:48,643
it allows that the application system, if I want to the test, i am system.gaiamobile.org:8080.

1797
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:50,611
And it is displayed in the browser.

1798
02:41:50,859 --> 02:41:52,044
Then, This is the start screen ...

1799
02:43:09,692 --> 02:43:11,532
Therefore, here it is in a true browser.

1800
02:43:12,643 --> 02:43:17,995
And, all of a sudden things one can do of this type ...

1801
02:43:22,923 --> 02:43:26,324
And there for the debug, it is just damned ...

1802
02:43:26,475 --> 02:43:30,732
Finally it is really much easier than with IOS, Android or anything else.

1803
02:43:31,924 --> 02:43:44,523
Here, for the moment, so it can be run in a browser because, in the application "Settings" I am trying to make sure that each time that the API which was needed was not exposed, i refer ...

1804
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:48,271
What my colleagues US call a "hoot PPI"

1805
02:43:48,647 --> 02:43:51,407
that is to say, i sends data cans just to not break the interface.

1806
02:43:51,621 --> 02:43:55,086
And so it allows debugging both simple and the interfaces, user interaction etcetera ...

1807
02:43:55,718 --> 02:43:58,638
Including for the things or y'a not of hardware support.

1808
02:43:59,238 --> 02:43:59,982
And therefore ...

1809
02:44:03,159 --> 02:44:06,342
Ah that is, it can even see bugs on the next version which is going to happen.

1810
02:44:08,751 --> 02:44:11,494
And in short, all of your applications you can test them like this.

1811
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:17,158
Therefore this are the development tools that are shipped with firefox for some time.

1812
02:44:17,366 --> 02:44:20,887
With the famous 3D view that you are talking about David all at the time.

1813
02:44:21,126 --> 02:44:22,287
Therefore it is in fact ...

1814
02:44:22,438 --> 02:44:27,853
I stored the signs to the effects of sliding, i the stores outside the visible part.

1815
02:44:28,814 --> 02:44:35,662
Therefore, this as a tool to debug, in addition of course to the console JS and company ...

1816
02:44:36,806 --> 02:44:39,583
It is ... it is really time to win a dog.

1817
02:44:39,697 --> 02:44:51,422
And it is almost here, it is not quite ready yet but by 2-3 days, 1 week, we will be able to run that ... here above.

1818
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:56,774
Which is to say, that we will have this view here for the content that is currently played in the phone.

1819
02:44:57,013 --> 02:45:00,198
So it will be a test even more easily ...

1820
02:45:01,118 --> 02:45:02,271
So there it is ...

1821
02:45:04,222 --> 02:45:11,975
Overall, the killers features, the stuff that really differentiate for developers Firefox OS of other mobile OS.

1822
02:45:17,606 --> 02:45:19,558
I believe that stupidly I closed the PDF. ..

1823
02:45:19,701 --> 02:45:21,558
but i think that I have finished ...
Ah yes he was there ...

1824
02:45:26,295 --> 02:45:27,174
Ah yes!

1825
02:45:29,342 --> 02:45:32,102
Therefore for those who have a little bit of time, who are curious, I have a device here.

1826
02:45:32,333 --> 02:45:34,814
That I will not leave the eyes but that you can try out.

1827
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:38,598
The three links who are there ...

1828
02:45:38,749 --> 02:45:43,775
then, sorry I have not talked about the marketplace but, overall, everything that is running there above turns on the marketplace.

1829
02:45:44,518 --> 02:45:49,518
And on the marketplace which has just been launched y'has a package of things that are funny , also to be tested on the desktop ...

1830
02:45:49,678 --> 02:45:52,245
Who are bidouillables, tiding ...

1831
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,014
bricolables ...

1832
02:45:54,422 --> 02:45:58,967
There'a a page any fresh who just to be created on mozilla.org which is called FirefoxOS in a single word.

1833
02:46:00,951 --> 02:46:06,846
And for the most curious of you, those who would like for example rotate the ... the emulator B2G, that I have launched earlier ...

1834
02:46:07,734 --> 02:46:10,462
You are looking for Gaia Hacking on the Mozilla Wiki ...

1835
02:46:10,646 --> 02:46:14,039
Y'all the explanations that are data in clear text, it is through the Internet.

1836
02:46:15,583 --> 02:46:16,247
That is that!

1837
02:46:16,703 --> 02:46:18,247
You may have questions?
<applaudissements>

1838
02:46:25,478 --> 02:46:33,151
A student: Tomorrow, I want to develop an application, it is as a simple application HTML5, behind y'a not a specific package to install it?

1839
02:46:33,407 --> 02:46:33,942
Non.

1840
02:46:34,574 --> 02:46:37,686
Then the question is: if I want to develop an application, what I need?

1841
02:46:38,622 --> 02:46:40,022
A text editor, a browser.

1842
02:46:49,463 --> 02:46:50,879
That is, that is what I wanted to show you here ...

1843
02:46:53,718 --> 02:46:54,894
This is what is called a manifest.

1844
02:46:58,046 --> 02:47:02,478
The manifest, it is actually a spec of the W3C now ...

1845
02:47:02,678 --> 02:47:12,502
because of the fact that Google happened to be before us, it must be type with underscores and this i think that I would take grudge to them for life ... this underscores.

1846
02:47:12,677 --> 02:47:13,870
Therefore here, settings, typically ...

1847
02:47:15,581 --> 02:47:17,997
That is, the MANIFEST settings ...

1848
02:47:18,526 --> 02:47:19,370
Ah shit!

1849
02:47:21,168 --> 02:47:22,186
I had not thought of it ...

1850
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:29,567
ya, this one is more than 5 lines but overall the 5 lines which you need, this is ... and yet ...

1851
02:47:30,855 --> 02:47:32,399
that is the permissions that are asked ...

1852
02:47:33,191 --> 02:47:42,271
this are the WebActivities therefore for those who are doing a bit of Android development, this is the response of Mozilla to the proposal of Google of ... the Web Intents List ...

1853
02:47:43,158 --> 02:47:45,758
We wanted to restrict a little the hint ...

1854
02:47:46,575 --> 02:47:47,790
And if not ...

1855
02:47:52,990 --> 02:47:57,023
That is, otherwise it is of the classic Web ... this is the application ?inext?

1856
02:47:57,391 --> 02:48:00,663
well, 68 kilo, y'a of the world inside.

1857
02:48:00,974 --> 02:48:02,758
But it is the beast HTML what.

1858
02:48:13,623 --> 02:48:17,030
It was not yet of discussion with the French operators.

1859
02:48:17,582 --> 02:48:26,695
Then, we will sell an improved version of this in Brazil next year.

1860
02:48:27,023 --> 02:48:28,639
And y'will have a version for the portugal also.

1861
02:48:28,830 --> 02:48:32,551
Therefore we can imagine that the French will be able to obtain this.

1862
02:48:33,782 --> 02:48:43,407
But after, what they hope we really, is that it can withstand officially of the devices more current.

1863
02:48:43,575 --> 02:48:49,487
Then, it had been thought to the L5 in LG, it had been thought the Samsung GS2, GS3.

1864
02:48:49,759 --> 02:48:51,751
we thought to other devices such as it ...

1865
02:48:52,191 --> 02:48:57,815
that could bear, that we could add to our priorities to ensure compatibility.

1866
02:49:03,159 --> 02:49:06,463
The LG L5, it is a device to less than $100.

1867
02:49:09,095 --> 02:49:11,335
And this is a good device already, it is between ...

1868
02:49:12,095 --> 02:49:17,265
And the GS2 and company, the reason for which you think is that ...

1869
02:49:17,529 --> 02:49:25,073
user ... finally ... most of the Web developers, they have an iPhone or a Galaxy.

1870
02:49:26,066 --> 02:49:33,787
And, all of a sudden, the guy that to a GS2 display, if it is Web developer, there'a a good chance that it is done its keke, it is purchased a GS3.

1871
02:49:34,193 --> 02:49:37,777
And suddenly his GS2 it might want to recycle in firefoxos.

1872
02:49:37,994 --> 02:49:41,409
And a GS2 in firefoxos, it really is a hint that he must see.

1873
02:49:41,762 --> 02:49:43,450
It is exhilarating!

1874
02:49:43,681 --> 02:49:44,874
It is astounding to performance!

1875
02:49:45,106 --> 02:49:48,594
And so it is a spacecraft, which gives udderly wanted to work with.

1876
02:49:49,553 --> 02:49:50,930
And, the screen is beautiful, finally ...

1877
02:49:51,177 --> 02:49:59,138
The coup, it is a spacecraft, which is expensive but for the people, and finally to a lot of people who are likely to work there above it is probably a spacecraft that they already have.

1878
02:49:59,354 --> 02:50:03,242
They just need a good excuse for the recycle, do something with them.

1879
02:50:04,178 --> 02:50:05,490
Rather than leave it in a drawer.

1880
02:50:05,933 --> 02:50:08,216
Therefore, we think but for now...

1881
02:50:09,304 --> 02:50:10,600
A student: And, is it that you can install it on an iPhone?

1882
02:50:10,992 --> 02:50:13,073
On a what?
(An iPhone)
I have not heard ...

1883
02:50:13,147 --> 02:50:19,661
<rires gÃ©nÃ©ral>
Non!

1884
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:24,900
No, we can not legally.

1885
02:50:25,245 --> 02:50:28,054
Apple has prohibited that we installed another rendering engine.

1886
02:50:28,237 --> 02:50:33,173
As you said David all in the time being, therefore, it is illegal to install a ...

1887
02:50:33,646 --> 02:50:34,861
A student: and, if I want to test?

1888
02:50:40,781 --> 02:50:42,974
well, after have to type any hardware compatibility and everything ...

1889
02:50:43,206 --> 02:50:43,934
it's going to be long.

1890
02:50:44,189 --> 02:50:47,901
It was posed the question to a given time at Mozilla for the mobile browser.

1891
02:50:48,125 --> 02:50:50,462
It was said, well we can do a Windows version.

1892
02:50:50,677 --> 02:50:54,965
We can do a Mac version ... finally a iPhone version.

1893
02:50:55,181 --> 02:50:57,902
And in fact, it was said, on iPhone clearly the interest is low.

1894
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:59,613
Because they already have a good browser.

1895
02:51:00,582 --> 02:51:06,125
But it was a little bit the fact that it is forbidden that we itch in is saying that it must be done ... but it was not done.

1896
02:51:07,006 --> 02:51:11,606
And in fact, I think it has done well to not do that because when we see how the iPhone are changing in a year on other ...

1897
02:51:11,781 --> 02:51:14,381
we would never had the patience to maintain that.

1898
02:51:14,557 --> 02:51:17,621
I see i run Linux, i had a Macbook for a year ...

1899
02:51:18,134 --> 02:51:18,638
More than ever!

1900
02:51:19,765 --> 02:51:27,493
It is .... I see the guy the energy they spend to try to stick to the equipment every year, each micro changes they make, it breaks all the drivers.

1901
02:51:27,894 --> 02:51:34,262
It is not, it is clearly not of the people with which it is pleasant to work when they are on the other side of the fence ...

1902
02:51:34,437 --> 02:51:36,037
that it is amateur, have done this on his free time ...

1903
02:51:36,229 --> 02:51:43,286
Then that, typically, y'has full of device which are very nice to hacker and we will clearly promote its devices here.

1904
02:51:43,573 --> 02:51:45,565
You want to do with the devices that are made to be clever hack.

1905
02:51:58,949 --> 02:51:59,358
Clearly.

1906
02:52:03,726 --> 02:52:08,229
Then, the question is: is it that we can imagine that firefoxos will be a day declined on PC fixed?

1907
02:52:08,429 --> 02:52:10,229
The official response, it is not obviously ...

1908
02:52:11,166 --> 02:52:13,045
But in fact, it is more ...

1909
02:52:13,213 --> 02:52:17,781
It is not poorly of Linux in the boutique, Mozilla ...

1910
02:52:18,198 --> 02:52:22,590
It is not poorly has not be excited by the new offices in the "newvt" , "NOP shell" and company.

1911
02:52:22,862 --> 02:52:25,286
And, overall ...

1912
02:52:25,789 --> 02:52:26,397
That is ...

1913
02:52:27,477 --> 02:52:33,142
An office type of a mozilien, it is of the terminals, full, and browser windows, full.

1914
02:52:35,766 --> 02:52:38,525
Y'has two ways to get a device in a browser window.

1915
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:42,077
The first is firessh, must first have a SSH server locally.

1916
02:52:42,253 --> 02:52:44,798
It connects over via an SSH client which falls in a Web tab.

1917
02:52:44,996 --> 02:52:50,142
It is a boyfriend to we, which is called Mime Cuvalo, who is the author of fireftp, who done it.

1918
02:52:50,333 --> 02:52:52,229
That hump now for Google stupidly ...

1919
02:52:52,429 --> 02:52:55,406
But which remains someone kind and infamous.

1920
02:52:56,630 --> 02:53:03,150
And, the other option, that is another mozilien, which is party at Google ... nan at Samsung.

1921
02:53:03,317 --> 02:53:04,230
Him by against we tell him about more ...

1922
02:53:06,621 --> 02:53:10,302
He made a plugin exactly what are those petitions relating ... finally globally that is ...

1923
02:53:10,453 --> 02:53:18,045
For the Linux to between you, y'has a kernel, finally y'has a component that is called ETV, which is a component that is used to make devices of environment GTK on Linux.

1924
02:53:18,949 --> 02:53:24,143
And, this guy here, for a fish of April, he had made a plugin for the ETV in a Web page.

1925
02:53:24,317 --> 02:53:25,702
Therefore to have a terminal in a Web page.

1926
02:53:25,845 --> 02:53:29,669
Then, for him it was a joke, he had found it very funny, he had done it for a 1 April.

1927
02:53:29,845 --> 02:53:32,221
There is full of people who have found it udderly well.

1928
02:53:32,453 --> 02:53:38,237
And suddenly it is found as a donkey to having to hold it because y'a of people who find this damned well, including me, I loved it!

1929
02:53:38,485 --> 02:53:41,701
And, therefore, there is a need for one of the two.

1930
02:53:42,997 --> 02:53:44,821
And after, there was a need for a desktop.

1931
02:53:45,053 --> 02:53:50,059
And, y'a a guy, a Frenchman who hump at ...

1932
02:53:50,971 --> 02:53:51,763
How?

1933
02:53:54,074 --> 02:54:04,803
There'a a guy from among us, a French, that hump at Mozilla in Mountainview, California, which has done, which has proposed a package, a .deb therefore a Debian package.

1934
02:54:05,523 --> 02:54:10,731
I don't know if it has proposed to Debian directly or if it is hosted at him under his own deposit, brief.

1935
02:54:11,090 --> 02:54:16,075
it allows you to launch B2G as desktop in place of Gnome, KDE, or i don't know what.

1936
02:54:21,242 --> 02:54:31,771
We began to consider to make the "tiling" in order to enjoy these interfaces which are intended for small screens on 24 inches or 12 inches as this one.

1937
02:54:33,523 --> 02:54:34,762
It has not yet looked at it ...

1938
02:54:35,394 --> 02:54:39,691
And, y'a a guy, I know more than that.

1939
02:54:40,587 --> 02:54:41,106
In short ...

1940
02:54:41,402 --> 02:54:47,722
That bump on raspberry PI and therefore, firefoxos typically, it causes it to turn on his raspberry PI and it is all content.

1941
02:54:47,923 --> 02:54:53,867
He has sent us a patch for we rubbed out the dependency to X11 so it was even more need for X11.

1942
02:54:54,331 --> 02:54:57,063
Therefore, it had started in half a second before with X11.

1943
02:54:57,063 --> 02:55:00,385
Now, without X11, i do not want to know, it must be ...

1944
02:55:00,463 --> 02:55:01,063
Finally short ...

1945
02:55:01,726 --> 02:55:02,980
it's going to be great class.

1946
02:55:03,292 --> 02:55:09,597
Therefore, for the moment it is clearly not a hint what is in the hands of all the world, but y'has a huge potential.

1947
02:55:09,813 --> 02:55:17,900
When one sees the job as it is to develop a complete desktop for Linux in relation to the job that it would be to make something like that in Web technology simple ...

1948
02:55:18,972 --> 02:55:20,148
We lack not much what.

1949
02:55:20,524 --> 02:55:24,085
Therefore, that is, it is two-three to indie top to our hours lost.

1950
02:55:24,308 --> 02:55:25,564
There has been little of hours lost in the moment.

1951
02:55:26,468 --> 02:55:28,100
But, ya y'to the projects.

1952
02:55:28,285 --> 02:55:35,308
And I hope that it will succeed because, I think that in the times for the average user, he will be please, very well.

1953
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:38,580
A hint that starts direct on Web applications even Gnome.
